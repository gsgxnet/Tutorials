1. Log on to the [ES5 System](https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com) to open a new session.
2. Open the following in a browser:

```
https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/SEPMRA_PO_APV/PurchaseOrders?$format=json
```

This shows you the raw data this OData service provides. This service runs in the ES5 system and returns purchase orders in the `JSON` format.
