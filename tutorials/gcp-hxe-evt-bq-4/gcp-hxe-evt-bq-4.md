## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to access plain schema from an HDI Container
  - How to create database objects using design-time artifacts
  - How to create a calculation view of type cube

**THIS TUTORIAL SERIES CAN ONLY BE EXECUTED AT TECHED**  as it is. Please find us at the Google booth in the AppSpace and we will provide everything you will need.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Add the user-provided service to your multi-target application)]

Go into the coding tools in SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA. Right-click on the database module and choose **`Modeling actions -> Add External SAP HANA Service`**.

![Add service](1.png)

Mark `Existing User Provided Service` and use the name `CROSS_SCHEMA_BIG`.

![Add service](2.png)

Click **Finish**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Import tables and data)]

To make the most of your time, you will import some pre-created tables and data to compare the current temperature measurements to the predictions.

Right-click on the project and use **Import -> File or Project**.

![Import](3.png)

Choose the file `db.zip` in the Desktop of your computer

![Import](4.png)

Leave the default values and click **OK**

![Import](5.png)

Confirm overwriting the existing files

![Import](6.png)

Once imported, expand the `db` module and **Build** the two inner folders

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create a calculation view)]

The import has created two tables and filled them with data. Those tables include a mapping for the periods to interpret the output of the predictive algorithm and some **fake** current measurements.

The objective of the calculation view you will create is to compare the predicted temperatures to current (fake) measurements.

You will find an empty folder called `models`. Right-click on it and choose **New -> Calculation View**.

Call it `HEAT_DEATH` and click **OK**

![New CV](9.png)

Start by clicking on the `join` node and then clicking on the canvas to drop it

![New CV](1.gif)

Click on the **+** sign to add a data source.

Check the `CROSS_SCHEMA_BIG` service and search for `OUT`. Choose the `OUTPUT_RESULTS` table and click **Finish**.

![New CV](10.png)

Click the **+** again to add another source. Choose `PERIODS`.

![New CV](11.png)

Double-click on the Join node

![New CV](12.png)

And drag the `ID` column from the left to the `ID` column on the right to connect them

![New CV](2.gif)

Set the join to `inner`, set the cardinality to `1..1` and click **Mapping**.

![New CV](13.png)

Double-click or drag the columns `PERIOD`, `FORECAST` and `HI95` to the output

![New CV](14.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Join data from current temperature)]

Drop a new `join` node into the canvas. Join the existing node with a new one using the connecting arrow on `Join_1`.

![New CV](3.gif)

Use the **+** sign to add another data source

![New CV](15.png)

Add `CURRENT_TEMP`, which was imported from the local `db.zip` file

![New CV](16.png)

Join them by `PERIOD`

![New CV](18.png)

Add `AVG_TEMP`, `PERIOD`, `FORECAST` AND `HI95` to the mapping

![New CV](19.png)

Connect the second join to the `Aggregation` node

![New CV](20.png)

Add all of the columns to the output

![New CV](21.png)

Click on **Calculated Columns** and add a calculated column

![New CV](22.png)

Open the editor for calculated columns

![New CV](23.png)

Call the column `FLAG_HEAT_DEATH`, set it to `Column engine` and add the following formula:

```text
IF("AVG_TEMP">"HI95",'Y','N')
```
![New CV](24.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Save, build and preview)]

**Save** and **Build** the view

![New CV](25.png)

Once the build is complete, right-click on the view and use **Data Preview** to view the results

![New CV](26.png)

You can drag the `PERIOD` into the `Label Axis` and the `AVG_TEMP` and `FORECAST` into the `Value Axis`. A line chart will be enough to visualize this
