7. Enter the respective app name in the search field, and click the pin icon to add these apps from the workflow catalog to your homepage:
      - My Inbox
      - Monitor Workflows (Definitions): Shows the deployed workflows and allows to start and download the workflow model.
      - Monitor Workflow (Instances): Shows the running workflow instances and helps in monitoring them.

You now see the apps on your SAP Fiori launchpad homepage.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Display your workflow definition and start an instance)]
1. To access your deployed workflow, open the **Monitor Workflow - Workflow Definitions** tile.
  The workflow is displayed and the version number is "1". The version number increases every time you deploy the workflow.
![Deployed Workflow](deployed-workflow.png)

    > You can display the running instances for a workflow with **Show Instances** (there are none yet).
    Typically, you would start a new workflow instance either from a UI or from another application using the workflow service REST API.

2. For testing purposes, choose **Start New Instance**.
3. On the popup, choose **Start New Instance**.
   Once the workflow has started, a confirmation message is displayed.

    >Because the workflow you modelled contains only a start and an end event, starting an instance is immediately completed and therefore not visible under "Show instances". (You can still retrieve completed instances through the REST API.)

    >Excursion: When you start a workflow, you can provide a JSON structure as input data. These JSON objects get stored within the workflow as context data. You can use them throughout the workflow, for example, in gateways, user tasks, or service tasks. For more information about handling workflow data, see [Manage Workflows Using the Monitor Workflows App] (https://help.sap.com/viewer/aa302ee52d3a4420b6cc3ecaaeee2ee7/Cloud/en-US/e6163e119ba645d0ae6a31022b670381.html).

4. Switch to the **Details** tab.
5. Under **Display Texts**, define the task subject, that is, the text that the user sees in his or her inbox.
   To show the book name, use an expression that references a field from the sample JSON structure. For more information about using expressions, see [Expressions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f85276c5069a429fa37d1cd352785c25/Cloud/en-US/9f91b1c0fac3414d9cba1015dea381f1.html).

    > The field is case sensitive.

7. Under **User Interface**, enter dummy entries (**`test`**) for the application and component names of the SAPUI component, which displays the task in the inbox.
