[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Extract the installation files.)]

Navigate to the directory where you wish to extract the installation files.

Extract the contents of the following files:

-   `hxe.tgz`
-   `eml.tgz` (if you are installing the External Machine Learning Library)
-   `hsa.tgz` (if you are installing streaming analytics)
-   `sdi.tgz` (if you are installing smart data integration)
-   `apl.tgz` (if you are installing the Automated Predictive Library)

```bash
tar -xvzf `download_path`/hxe.tgz
```

```bash
tar -xvzf `download_path`/eml.tgz
```

```bash
tar -xvzf `download_path`/hsa.tgz
```

```bash
tar -xvzf `download_path`/sdi.tgz
```

```bash
tar -xvzf `download_path`/apl.tgz
```

> Note:
> Run the `tar` command from the command shell as shown, rather than using a GUI-based extraction tool.
> 
> 

> Note:
> You may have to give these files run permissions. Example:
> 
> ```bash
> chmod -R 777 `download_path`/hxe.tgz
> ```
> 
>

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Start the installation.)]

Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files and run `./setup_hxe.sh` as the root user:

```bash
cd `extracted_path`
sudo ./setup_hxe.sh
```

Follow the prompts to configure your installation.

> Note:
> The master password you specify during installation is used for the `sid``adm` and `sapadm` OS users, the telemetry technical user, and the SYSTEM user. The password is also used for the following users in additional components:
> 
> -   `SYS_STREAMING` and `SYS_STREAMING_ADMIN` (streaming analytics)
> 
> SAP HANA, express edition requires a `very strong password` that complies with these rules:
> 
> -   At least 8 characters
> -   At least 1 uppercase letter
> -   At least 1 lowercase letter
> -   At least 1 number
> -   Can contain special characters, but not ``` ` ``` (backtick), `$` (dollar sign), `\` (backslash), `'` (single quote), or `"` (double quotes)
> -   Cannot contain simplistic or systematic values, like strings in ascending or descending numerical or alphabetical order
>
