[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Load data into SAP Vora)]
To be able to profile data in SAP Vora, you first need to load data into SAP Vora. Thereto open the SAP Data Hub Cockpit (`https://vhcalhxedb:51076/`) via a web browser.

Enter `DATAHUB` as **HANA Username** and the password which you have selected during system setup as **HANA Password** to logon to SAP Data Hub Cockpit. The system displays the **Overview** page.

Navigate to the **SAP Vora Tools** by clicking **link (1)** on the bottom of the screen. You have to logon again. Enter `default` as **Tenant ID**, `DATAHUB` as **Username** and the password which you have selected during system setup as **Password**. The system displays the **SAP Vora Tools**.

Create a new relational table by clicking **Create New (2)**. If you don't see the welcome screen like the one in the above screenshot, click on the **+** button (highlighted in the screenshot, in upper left corner) and navigate to **Create Relational Table**.

![picture_03](./datahub-trial-discovery-part02_03.png)  

Enter the following information to create the relational table and then click **Next (3)** :

| Field &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                          | Value                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`                         | `CUSTOMERS`                                                                                 |
| `Schema`                       | `VORA`                                                                                      |
| `Engine`                       | `Relational`                                                                                |
| `File Type`                    | `CSV`                                                                                       |
| `Delimiter`                    | `;`                                                                                         |
| `CSV Skip Value`               | `1`                                                                                         |
| `File System`                  | `GCS`                                                                                       |
| `GCS Client Email`             | from your Google Cloud Platform service account (attribute `client_email` from .json file)  |
| `GCS Private Key`              | from your Google Cloud Platform service account (attribute `private_key` from .json file **without** `\n` at the end of the attribute ) |
| `GCS Project ID`               | from your Google Cloud Platform service account (attribute `project_id` from .json file)    |
| `GCS Path`                     | bucket, in our case `datahub-trial`                                                         |
| `GCS File Path`                | file path via **Browse** button, in our case `/Customers.csv`                               |

![picture_04](./datahub-trial-discovery-part02_04.png)  

On the next screen, change the **data type (4)** of the `CUSTOMER` column to `BIGINT`. Finally click **Finish** to create the table.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Preview table)]
Go back to the SAP Data Hub Cockpit and Navigate to **Discovery**.

![picture_06](./datahub-trial-discovery-part02_06.png)  

Expand the `VORA_CATALOG_CONN_DEFAULT (5)` connection and click on **VORA (6)** to display the tables in SAP Vora in schema `VORA`. In our example you see exactly one table, namely the table `CUSTOMERS`, which you created during the previous step.


Select the `CUSTOMERS` table and then take a look at the content of the table by clicking **Preview (7)** in the toolbar in the upper right of the screen.

![picture_07](./datahub-trial-discovery-part02_07.png)  

You see the first 100 rows of the table. Obviously the table stores the same customer data as the `Customers.csv` file (that is where you loaded the data from into the table). Navigate back by clicking on the **Discovery (8)** link.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Profile table)]
Next you profile the table. Profiling determines all kind of metadata about the table.

![picture_08](./datahub-trial-discovery-part02_08.png)  

Select the `CUSTOMERS` table and profile it by clicking **Profiling -> Start Profiling (9)**.

The system indicates that profiling started. It can take several minutes for profiling to complete. You can refresh the screen by clicking **Refresh (9)**. That is the right-most button in the toolbar in the upper right of the screen.

![picture_09](./datahub-trial-discovery-part02_09.png)  

When profiling completed, the system will display the profiling status as `Profiled`.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Display metadata and fact sheet)]
You can take a look at metadata and fact sheet of the `CUSTOMERS` table just like you did during the previous tutorial for the files.

Open the fact sheet for `Customers.csv` that you have profiled just now and answer the following questions with the help of the below screenshot :
