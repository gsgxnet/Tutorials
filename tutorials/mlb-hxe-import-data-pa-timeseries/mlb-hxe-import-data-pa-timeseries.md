## Details
### You will learn
In this tutorial, you will learn how to download and import the SAP Predictive Analytics Time Series sample dataset into your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Info: ](Sample file structure)]

The archive structure for the  [**Sample Time Series**](https://help.sap.com/http.svc/download?deliverable_id=20555051) is the following:

```
|--sample_time_series_3.3.1_en-us_production.zip
   |-- Time series.zip
   |   |-- Time series
   |       |-- CashFlows.txt
   |       |-- KxDesc_CashFlows.txt
   |       |-- Lag1AndCycles.txt
   |       |-- Lag1AndCyclesAndWn.txt
   |       |-- R_ozone-la.txt
   |       |-- TrendAndCyclic.txt
   |       |-- TrendAndCyclicAnd_4Wn.txt
   |       |-- TrendAndCyclicAndWn.txt
   |-- metadata.xml
```

**Note:** `desc` and `KxDesc` files are SAP Predictive Analytics dataset description files and will not be loaded.

#### **Cash Flows**

The Cash Flows file (`CashFlows.txt`) presents daily measures of cash flows from January 2, 1998 to September, 30 1998. Each observation is characterized by 25 variables described in the following table.

| Variable                                                                        | Description                                                        | Example of values

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create the table structure)]

Connect to the **HXE** tenant using the **`ML_USER`** user credentials and execute the following SQL statement to create the table structure:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE PA_DATA.CASHFLOW (
    CASHDATE                    DAYDATE,

    PRIMARY KEY (READINGDATE)
);
```

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Download the Sample Data)]

Open the [SAP Predictive Analytics documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS) page in a browser and click on the **View All** for the **Sample** section.

This will display the list of sample dataset available.

Right-click on the **Download the Sample Time Series** link and use the **Save link address** to get the download URL.

Open the download URL and save the sample data archive either:

- the Eclipse host if you want to use the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse
- the SAP HANA, express host if you want the IMPORT FROM SQL command

Extract the files (located in the `Time Series` subdirectory in the embedded `Time Series.zip` archive).

#### **Import Using the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse**

You can extract the sample file anywhere you want on the Eclipse host.

You can now move to **Step 3: Import Using the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse**.

#### **Import Using the IMPORT FROM SQL command**

You can extract the sample file anywhere you want on the Eclipse host.

Here is an example script that you reuses to download and extract the sample dataset from the SAP HANA, express edition host:

```shell
URL=https://help.sap.com/http.svc/download?deliverable_id=20555051
OUTPUT_FILE=sample_timeseries
OUTPUT_DIR=/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90/work/$OUTPUT_FILE

 # create a new subdirectory for the sample data
mkdir $OUTPUT_DIR

 # download the archive in the sample data directory
 # wget -O $OUTPUT_DIR/$OUTPUT_FILE.zip $URL
curl $URL -o $OUTPUT_DIR/$OUTPUT_FILE.zip

 # switch to the new directory
cd $OUTPUT_DIR

 # extract all archives and embedded archives
while [ "`find . -type f -name '*.zip' | wc -l`" -gt 0 ]; \
  do find -type f -name "*.zip" \
      -exec unzip -o --  '{}' \; \
      -exec rm -- '{}' \;; done
 # remove space from file and directory names
for f in *\ *; do mv "$f" "${f// /}"; done      
```

It requires CURL (or WGET) to be installed.

The dataset files should now be located in: **`/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90/work/sample_timeseries/Timeseries`**

You can now move to **Step 3: Import Using the IMPORT FROM SQL command**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Import Using the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse)]

You can import the data using the [SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse Import feature](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/mlb-hxe-import-data-eclipse.html) using the following details:

- **File Details:**

    - Set the **Field Delimiter** value to **Tab (\t)**.
    - Check the **Header row exists** box and set the **Header row** value to 1
    - Check the **Import all data** box.

- **Manage Table Definition and Data Mappings:**

    Using the **Mapping menu** icon, select the **One by One** option.

The source files should be mapped with the following target tables:

| Source File                   | Target Table      
| ----------------------------- | -----------------
| `CashFlows.txt`               | `PA_DATA.CASHFLOW`
| `R_ozone-la.txt`              | `PA_DATA.OZONE`
| `Lag1AndCycles.txt`           | `PA_DATA.LAG_1_AND_CYCLES`
| `Lag1AndCyclesAndWn.txt`      | `PA_DATA.LAG_1_AND_CYCLES_AND_WN`
| `TrendAndCyclic.txt`          | `PA_DATA.TREND_AND_CYCLIC`
| `TrendAndCyclicAnd_4Wn.txt`   | `PA_DATA.TREND_AND_CYCLIC_AND_4WN`
| `TrendAndCyclicAndWn.txt`     | `PA_DATA.TREND_AND_CYCLIC_AND_WN`

[DONE]
