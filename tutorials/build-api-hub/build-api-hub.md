In the UI Editor, you will have a blank screen. Add some controls to the page by searching in the Controls pane on the left side of the screen. Once you find the control you want to add, drag and drop it on to the canvas. Add a **List** control to the page. Search for _list_ in the controls pane.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Explore data sources)]

To add a data model to a prototype, click on the **Data** tab on the left hand side of the screen. There are a couple options for adding a data model. You can use Excel files if you have your own data structure to follow, or you can use an existing SAP service such as an API from the SAP API Business Hub. To import data from the API Hub, **click the Import an API Hub data source** link.

This will bring up the SAP API Business Hub browser. You can search for APIs or filter the APIs to a certain package to find the right data for you.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Select a data source)]

In the API Hub browser, select the **SAP Hybris Cloud for Customer - OData API** from the Package dropdown.

![Cloud for Customer package selection](12.png)

This will filter the list down to 3 API packages. Select the **Product Entity** package. Once it is selected, click **Add**.

The data structures for the Product API are now available in your Data panel. To bind the data into the list, you can just drag and drop it. Drag the whole **Product** entity and drop it onto the **List control**.

Once you dropped the entity on the list, you list should look like the screenshot below.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Bind data to controls)]

The data that is automatically bound the control is based off the name of the control and the name of the field. Some of the fields bound don't make sense, so you can fix them by dragging the individual field onto the control.

Expand the **Product** object in the Data panel by clicking the arrow next to it.

![expanded fields of Product entity](16.png)
