[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Test XSC)]

Check that the XSEngine is running. From your host OS (not the VM guest) open a browser and enter:

```bash
http://<hxehost IP address>:8090
```

You recorded the IP address earlier in [Start SAP HANA, express edition Server](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-getting-started-vm-xsa.html). A success page displays. This indicates that XSC is running:

> Note:
> SAP plans to remove SAP HANA extended application services, classic model (XSC) and the corresponding SAP HANA Repository with the next major product version of SAP HANA.
>
> These components will be removed:
>
> -   SAP HANA extended application services, classic model
>
> -   SAP HANA Repository (XS classic)
>
> -   SAP HANA Studio (Development, Modeling, and Administration perspectives)
>
> -   SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench (XS classic)
>
>
> SAP strongly advises you to plan the transition of existing content and applications from XSC to SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model (XS Advanced).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Test XSA)]

1.   Go back to your VM. Log in to XSA services:

    ```bash
    xs-admin-login
    ```

2.   When prompted for the `XSA_ADMIN` password, enter the master password

    You specified this password when you were prompted for the HANA database master password earlier in [Start SAP HANA, express edition Server](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-getting-started-vm-xsa.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ]((Optional) Turn on XSA messaging)]

If you want the XSA messaging service, issue these commands to start the messaging service applications:

```bash
xs start messaging-service-hub
xs start messaging-service-node
xs start messaging-service-broker

```

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Test SAP Web IDE)]

1.   Display the status and URL for the application `webide`. Enter:

    ```bash
    xs apps | grep webide
    ```

    ![loio5e7c5697cabd467daa1bd966ab372ae8_LowRes](loio5e7c5697cabd467daa1bd966ab372ae8_LowRes.png)

2.   Check that the application `webide` shows `STARTED` in the list of XSA applications, and has 1/1 instances. (If the output shows 0/1 in the instance column, the application is not started.)

    > Note:
    > Normally it only takes a few minutes for XSA services to start. However. depending on your machine, it can take over 30 minutes for XSA services to begin. If the service doesn't show `STARTED` and doesn't show `1/1` instances, keep waiting until the service is enabled.
    >
    >

    Make a note of the URL for `webide`.

3.   Test your Web IDE connection. Enter the URL for Web IDE in a browser on your laptop.

    ```bash
    Example: https://hxehost:53075
    ```

    ![loiocf1862543d7b495a87d621cf3680580f_LowRes](loiocf1862543d7b495a87d621cf3680580f_LowRes.png)

4.   For *HANA Username*, enter `XSA_DEV`.

    You specified this password when you were prompted for `HANA database master password` in [Start SAP HANA, express edition Server](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-getting-started-vm-xsa.html).

    Web IDE displays.![loioc06ad641e44240b99da7bd10cd275377_LowRes](loioc06ad641e44240b99da7bd10cd275377_LowRes.png)

    If you are prompted to change your password, follow the instructions.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Test Cockpit)]

1.   Go back to your VM. Enter:

    ```bash
    xs apps | grep cockpit-admin-web-app
    ```

2.   Check that the application `cockpit-admin-web-app` shows `STARTED` in the list of XSA applications and has 1/1 instances.

    ![loio26bc3a5355cf49a49ca8f213fbf28a97_LowRes](loio26bc3a5355cf49a49ca8f213fbf28a97_LowRes.png)

    > Note:
    > Normally it only takes a few minutes for XSA services to start. However. depending on your machine, it can take over 30 minutes for XSA services to begin. If the service doesn't show `STARTED` and doesn't show `1/1` instances, keep waiting until the service is enabled.
    >
    >

    Make a note of the URL for `cockpit-admin-web-app`.

3.   Check that the application `xsa-cockpit` shows `STARTED` in the list of XSA applications and has 1/1 instances. Enter:

    ```bash
    xs apps | grep xsa_cockpit
    ```

    > Note:
    > Normally it only takes a few minutes for XSA services to start. However. depending on your machine, it can take over 30 minutes for XSA services to begin. If the service doesn't show `STARTED` and doesn't show `1/1` instances, keep waiting until the service is enabled.

4.   In a browser on your laptop, enter the `cockpit-admin-web-app` URL you noted earlier.

    The Cockpit log in page displays.

5.   For *HANA Username*, enter `XSA_ADMIN`.

6.   For *HANA Password*, enter the master password.

    You specified this password when you were prompted for `HANA database master password` earlier in this tutorial.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ]((Optional) Test with HANA Eclipse Plugin)]

Download and install the HANA Eclipse Plugin to your host OS (not the VM guest) and connect to SAP HANA 2.0, express edition.

1.   Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers from Eclipse, for [Neon](http://www.eclipse.org/neon/) or [Mars](http://www.eclipse.org/mars/) releases, to your local file system.

2.   Follow the eclipse installer prompts.

3.   Launch when prompted, or go to the eclipse folder (example: `C:\Users\<path>\eclipse\jee-neon`) and run the eclipse executable file.

4.   Follow the tutorial [How to download and install the HANA Eclipse plugin](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-howto-eclipse.html).
