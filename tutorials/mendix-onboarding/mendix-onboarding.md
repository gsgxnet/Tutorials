You need to set up an environment for your SAP app. An environment points to the Cloud Foundry environment that you want to deploy to.

In the development portal home page, choose **Create App**.

![Open Mendix portal](mendix-onboarding7.png)

If not already selected, choose SAP Apps to see the SAP-related templates.

![SAP templates](mendixSAPApps.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Build your app)]
To start working on your app, choose **Edit App**.

![Build app](mendix-onboarding14.png)

You build apps using the Mendix Desktop Modeler, which is an application installed on your desktop. If you don't have the modeler, install it by going to the [app store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modeler/).
