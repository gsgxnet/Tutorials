[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Download the archive)]

Download the file `data.zip` from our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP/com.sap.openSAP.hana5.templates/raw/hana2_sps01/ex2/core-db/data.zip).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Import Archive)]

Import the archive into the data folder. This will probably be `src\data`. Right-click on the folder and choose `Import->From File System`:

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Purge duplicates and Build)]

Delete the files `FLIGHT.hdbcds`, `header.csv`,  `item.csv` and `load.hdbtabledata` (if available) to avoid conflicts during build:

**Build** the db module:

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Check the imported entities in the Database Explorer)]

Formerly known as HANA Runtime Tools or `HRTT` in previous versions, the Database Explorer allows you to see the database artifacts you create in the different HDI containers. Use the middle icon on the left sidebar or from the menu, `Tools->Database Explorer`:

>In SPS12, the HANA Runtime Tool was accessed from `https://<hostname>:51006` or, for `SAP HANA, express edition`. from `http://<hostname>:51018`

Use the `+` icon to add a database container into the Explorer.

Locate your HDI container and add it. You will find it as a concatenation of your user ID and the name of your project.

Once added you can see the tables and their content.
