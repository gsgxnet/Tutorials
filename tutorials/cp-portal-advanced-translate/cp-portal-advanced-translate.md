## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to manage translations of your SAP Cloud Platform Portal site texts
  - How to use SAP Translation Hub to translate the SAP Cloud Platform Portal site texts

This allows SAP Cloud Platform Portal site admins to create multilingual sites, translate their site resources, and allows end users to choose their desired language.

In this tutorial, you will download the Supplier Portal site's translatable resources in their master locale (English). You will use the SAP Translation Hub to automatically translate the resources into several target languages and upload the translated resources back to your portal site.

The SAP Translation Hub automatically translates the uploaded text resources into the target languages. Users can than validate the translations and manually modify them.

> For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial we will assume that the translations suggested by the automatic translation process are accurate.
