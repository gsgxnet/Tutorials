## Prerequisites  
 - Verify that the ES5 destination you created in your account contains the property **Usage** = `Backend`. If not, add it.

## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to expose a Web Dynpro ABAP backend application to your SAP Cloud Platform Portal site
  - How to set up an external access point landscape allowing your end users to consume SAP backend apps (Web Dynpro ABAP and SAP GUI for HTML) outside of the corporate network

SAP customers who run classic SAP UI applications on their data center backend can transition to the SAP Cloud Platform and continue using these applications.
