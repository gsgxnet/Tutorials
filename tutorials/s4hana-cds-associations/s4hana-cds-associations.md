## Prerequisites  
 - **Tutorials:**
 - [Core Data  Services](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/s4hana-cds-associations.html)
 - [Preparing views for Associations/Joins](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/s4hana-cds-preparing-views-associations.html)

## Next Steps
[Creating OData-Service based on `CDS-view`](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/s4hana-cds-creating-odata-service.html)


## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to join many views together


---


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Check basic view)]

Make sure that the basic view from the previous tutorials of this series is available

![The basic view to be inserted](BasicViewToBeEnhanced_01.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Enhancing the basic view)]

Let's consider the coding of the view `ZXSHI_AIRLINE` again. We will enhance that code by inserting new annotations:

The following is an annotation to make the view usable for BW by inserting the line below after line 6.

``` abap
@Analytics.dataExtraction.enabled: true  
```

![Annotation for data extraction added](AnnDataExtractionTomakeUsableForBW_02.png)

Here is the new line, completed.

![Annotation for data extraction added](AddAnnotationDataExtractionForBW_03.png)

Here you can enable the Joins by inserting the line below after line 7.

``` abap
@ObjectModel.representativeKey: 'Airline'
```

![First Annotation added](AddAnnotationForAssociationEnabling_04.png)

Here is the new line, completed.

![Second Annotation added](AddAnnotationForAssociationEnabling_05.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Remove the filter from the code)]

Since we do not use any filter, we will delete line 2 ( `@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true`) from the code.

![Filter is removed](FilterRemoving_06.png)

Here is the code after the deletion.

![Coding](CodeAfterFilterRemoving_07.png)



[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Add association annotations)]


Here you will enhance the code to make it capable for joins. To achieve this the following line will be inserted after line 8 in the code.

```abap
...as select from scarr association [0..1] to ZXSH_I_AirlineText
```

![Annotation syntax added](AddingAssociationSyntax_08.png)

Here is the new line, completed.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Insert the alias text)]

To display the Carrier name, insert the alias `_Text`

![Alias text added](AddingAliasText_10.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Define the Join projection)]

Further enhancement is necessary (in projection capacity) to make the view joinable. To achieve this,  extend the above alias insertion with `on $projection.Airline = _Text.Airline`.

![Definition of join and projection](DefineTheJoinProjection_11.png)

> If you hover the icon on the line 10 the following message will be displayed:  `Association _Text is not used`

![Adding text is not defined](_Text_Is_NotDefined_12.png)

The alias `_Text` must be declared (see number 2 in the screen shot below) and the comma (number 1 in the screen shot) at the end of line 17 must not be omitted. Next, save and activate the code.

![ Text and comma inserted](Insert_Text_and_Coma_13.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Preview the content of the view)]

You can now preview the content of the  view **`ZXSHI_AIRLINE`**. On the left panel, select and right-click on the view **`ZXSHI_AIRLINE`**, select **Open Data Preview** and then press **Enter**.

![Preview the joined basic view](PreviewBasicViewJoined_14.png)   

Below is the data preview.

![Preview the joined basic view](PreviewBasicViewJoined_15.png)

> As you may have noticed, the Airline Name is not visible on the preview screen.

Now change line 18 of the code as follows: `_Text.AirlineName`.

![Text enhancement](Enhance_Text_16.png)

Here you see the change added.

![Text enhancement](Enhance_Text__Activate_Save17.png)

Save the change, activate it and preview the view's content again.

![Activation of the text enhancement](Enhance_Text__Activate_Save18.png)

> In the preview screen you will see now a new column labeled with `AirlineName` displaying the Carrer name.

![Preview the basic airline view ](PreviewBasicViewAirlineName_19.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Final changes)]

To handle the next exercise of this series , we will modify  the line 18 again by removing the extension `AirlineName` from `_Text.AirlineName` to have `_Text`. We will now have to save and activate our change.

![Final code without the extension](FinalCodeWithoutExtentionAfter_Text_20.png)

You can copy this content from here and paste it to the code editor of your ABAP perspective as well, instead of enhancing the generated code and typing on your own:
``` abap
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZXSHIAIRLINE'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'Airline'
@VDM.viewType: #BASIC
@Analytics.dataCategory: #DIMENSION
@Analytics.dataExtraction.enabled: true
@ObjectModel.representativeKey: 'Airline'
define view ZxshI_Airline
as select from scarr
association [0..1] to ZXSH_I_AirlineText as _Text
on $projection.Airline = _Text.Airline
{
key scarr.carrid as Airline,
@Semantics.currencyCode: true
scarr.currcode as AirlineLocalCurrency,
@Semantics.url: true
scarr.url as AirlineURL,  
_Text

}
```
