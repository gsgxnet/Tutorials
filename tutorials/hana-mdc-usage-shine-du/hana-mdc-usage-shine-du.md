### Add and Configure a Cloud System

1. [Install](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/help/frameset.htm?b0e351ada628458cb8906f55bcac4755.html) SAP HANA Tools for your Eclipse.
2. Go to your **Eclipse > Window > Perspective > Open Perspective** and then choose **SAP HANA Administration Console**.
3. In the **Systems** view, just right-click on the white field and choose **Add Cloud System**.
4. Now, you are on the account information page and you have to enter your developer account details and then choose **Next**.

    If you are confused about the account name and user name, you can go to [SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/) and there you can see your account name on the tile and if you click on it, then in the URL. The user name is the same name, just without the "trial" part.

5. Choose your tenant database, which you've already created and enter the database user name **SYSTEM** and password you specified when you created this database. Then choose **Finish**.

7. **Refresh** the Delivery Unit in HANA Application Lifecycle Management to check that the **`HCO_DEMOCONTENT_11.1.tgz`** archive is there. This means that the SHINE application is successfully imported.
