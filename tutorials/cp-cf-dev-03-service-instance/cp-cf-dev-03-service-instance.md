## Details
### You will learn  
- How apps and services are related
- How to bind a service to an app

In the Cloud Foundry environment there are apps and there are services. In many cases, apps are what you write, and services are what are available for your app to make use of.

PostgreSQL is a service that is available and to make use of it you create an instance of that service and bind it to your app. You can manage the availability of services, and the instances thereof, in the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit.
