1. From the previous tutorial you should now have your SAP HANA Studio connected to your SAP HANA, express edition. Therefore, the next step is to create a link to the SAP HANA repository.

    Be sure to switch your perspective to the `SAP HANA DEVELOPMENT` one. To make the next steps work properly.

2. Now that you have the repository linked you can create your first project. This initial project will be the basis for a series of tutorials.

3. The first step to create your new repository will be select "File" then "New" and from the drop down you will select a "Project" under the "General" section.

4. The project name will be `mylocation` as the idea behind this project will be a simple SAP HANA application around geographical location.

5. Once the project is created you will need to create your initial `.xsapp`file to signify that it is an XS application followed by an `.xsaccess` file to define settings for the application. You can use either the wizard to select the `XS Application Descriptor File` and `XS Application Access File`

	or simply the "File" - "New" option and manually type the name `.xsapp` and `.xsacess` being sure to include the `.` first.

6. The content of your `.xsaccess` file is quite simple.

	```
	{
		"exposed": true
	}
	```

	The content of the `.xsapp` can actually be empty.
