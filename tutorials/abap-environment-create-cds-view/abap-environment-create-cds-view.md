[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Open Eclipse)]
Select to your ABAP package created in tutorial **Create Simple Database Table for ABAP Environment** and create a Core Data Services (CDS) data definition.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create data definition)]
1. Search for **data definition**, select it and click **Next**.

    ![Create data definition](definition.png)

2. Enter a name and a description for your data definition `ZI_BOOKING_XXX`.

    ![Create data definition](data.png)

3. Select a new transport request and click **Next**.

    ![Create data definition](transport.png)

4. Select **Define View template** and press **Finish**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Specify SQL view)]
1. Specify the `sql view name` in the view definition as **`ZV_BOOKING_XXX`**.

    ![Specify SQL view](cds.png)

2. Specify your data source after the select from statement as **`ztbooking_xxx`**.

    ![Specify SQL view](cds2.png)

3. Specify your data definition as shown below.

    The keyword key is used to specific a key element and the keyword as is used to define alias names. The two associations `I_Country` and `I_Currency` are defined and exposed in the projection. The element `CurrencyCode` is specified as currency key for the element Cost which is an amount field. The view entity is specified as searchable using the view annotation `@Search.searchable: true` and the element `CustomerName` is specified as default search element using the element annotation `@Search.defaultSearchElement: true`.

    ```swift
    @AbapCatalog.sqlViewName 'ZV_BOOKING_XXX'
    @AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter : true
    @AbapCatalog.preserveKey: true
    @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK
    @EndUserText.label : 'Data Definition Booking'
    @Search.searchable : true
    define view ZI_BOOKING_XXX
       as select from ztbooking_xxx as Booking
       association [0..1] to I_Country  as _Country  on $projection.country = _Country.country
       association [0..1] to I_Currency as _Currency on $projection.CurrencyCode = _Currency.Currency

       {
         key booking              as Booking,
             @Search.defaultSearchElement: true
             customername         as CustomerName,
             numberofpassengers   as NumberOfPassengers,
             emailaddress         as EmailAddress,
             country,
             dateofbooking        as DateOfBooking,
             dateoftravel         as DateOfTravel,
             @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'CurrencyCode'
             cost,
             @Semantics.currencyCode: true
             currencycode          as CurrencyCode,
             lastchangedat         as LastChangedAt,

             _Country,
             _Currency       
    }
    ```
    Save and activate.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Add UI annotation)]
1. Go back to the data definition and used the **`@UI`** annotations to add the UI-specific semantics. Add following UI annotation in front of your data definition.

    ![Add UI annotation](ui.png)

    ```swift
    @UI: {
      headerInfo: {
      typeName: 'Booking',
      typeNamePlural: 'Bookings',
      title: { type: #STANDARD, value: 'Booking' }
      }
    }
    ```

2. Replace your code with following:

    ```swift
    define view ZI_Booking_XXX
      as select from ztbooking_xxx as Booking
      association [0..1] to I_Country  as _Country  on $projection.country = _Country.Country
      association [0..1] to I_Currency as _Currency on $projection.CurrencyCode = _Currency.Currency
    {

          @UI.facet: [
            {
              id:       'Booking',
              purpose:  #STANDARD,
              type:     #IDENTIFICATION_REFERENCE,
              label:    'Booking',
              position: 10 }
          ]


          @UI: {
              lineItem: [ { position: 10, importance: #HIGH, label: 'Booking ID' } ],
              identification:[ { position: 10, label: 'Booking ID' } ]
              }
      key booking                                as Booking,

          @UI: {
            lineItem: [ { position: 20, label: 'Customer', importance: #HIGH } ],
            identification:[ { position: 10, label: 'Customer' } ]
          }

          identification:[ { position: 30, label: 'No of Passengers' } ]
          }
          numberofpassengers                     as NumberOfPassengers,

          @UI: {
               identification:[ { position: 40, label: 'Email' } ]
           }
          emailaddress                           as EmailAddress,

          @UI: {
               identification:[ { position: 50, label: 'Country' } ]
           }
          country,

          @UI: {
               identification:[ { position: 60, label: 'Booked On' } ]
           }
          dateofbooking                          as DateOfBooking,

          @UI: {   identification:[ { position: 70, label: 'Traveling on' } ]    }
          dateoftravel                           as DateOfTravel,


          @UI: {
          lineItem: [ { position: 40, label: 'Cost', importance: #HIGH } ],
          identification:[ { position: 80, label: 'Cost' } ]
          }
          @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'CurrencyCode'
          cost,

          @UI: { identification:[ { position: 90, label: 'Currency' } ]     }
          @Semantics.currencyCode: true
          currencycode                           as CurrencyCode,

          @UI: { identification:[ { position: 100, label: 'Last Changed At' } ] }
          lastchangedat                          as LastChangedAt,

          //publich associations
          _Country,
