## Prerequisites  
 - [Create a global ABAP Class](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/abap-dev-create-new-class.html)

## Next Steps
 - [Display a CDS view using ALV with IDA](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/abap-dev-adt-use-cds-view.html)


## Details
### You will learn  
In the following exercise you will learn how to use the new Core Data Services (CDS) tools in ABAP in Eclipse. CDS is an extension of the ABAP Dictionary that allows you to define semantically rich data models in the database and to use these data models in your ABAP programs. CDS is a central part of enabling code push-down in ABAP applications.
You will add the following:

- SELECT statement
- CASE statement
- WHERE clause

You can find more information about CDS in the [ABAP keyword documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/abencds.htm) and the [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/community/topic/abap.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a CDS view)]
  1. In the context menu of your package choose **New** and then choose **Other ABAP Repository Object**.
  ![Image depicting step1-newObject](step1-newObject.png)

  2. Select **Data Definition**, then choose **Next**.
  ![Image depicting step2-DataDef](step2-DataDef.png)

  3. Enter the following values, then choose **Next**:
    -	Name = **`Z_INVOICE_ITEMS`**
    - Description = **Invoice Items**
  ![Image depicting step3-enterValues](step3-enterValues.png)

  4. Accept the default transport request (local) by simply choosing **Next** again.

  5. Select the entry **Define View**, then choose **Finish**
  ![Image depicting step5-defineView](step5-defineView.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Enter the data source)]
The new view appears in an editor. In this editor, enter the following values:

  1. Enter `ZINVOICEITEMS` as the SQL view name.
  2. Enter the CDS view `sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item` as the data source for your view.
  3. Use code completion (keyboard shortcut **CTRL+SPACE**) to get proposals for the data source.
  ![Image depicting step6-enterDataSourceEtc](step6-enterDataSourceEtc.png)

> Note: The SQL view name is the internal/technical name of the view which will be created in the database. `Z_Invoice_Items` is the name of the CDS view which provides enhanced view-building capabilities in ABAP. You should always use the CDS view name in your ABAP applications.


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Edit the SELECT statement)]
You will now insert the fields `currency_code` and `gross_amount` into the SELECT list as follows:

  1. Trigger code completion in the SELECT list (by clicking on the SELECT list and using keyboard shortcut **CTRL+SPACE**), then double click on the entry **Insert all elements - template**. All the elements (fields and associations) of the underlying data source are inserted into the SELECT list.
  2. Remove all the elements in the SELECT list which were inserted by the code completion apart from `currency_code` and `gross_amount`. Remember to separate the elements in the SELECT statement with a comma.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Use an existing CDS association)]
You will now model the relationships between data sources by using some existing CDS associations. You can use associations in path expressions to access elements (fields and associations) in related data sources without specifying JOIN conditions. You can now display the element info by positioning the cursor on the data source name **`sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item`** and choosing **F2**.

To see the related data sources that can be accessed using associations, scroll down.
To see details about the target data source of the association header, choose the hyperlink **`sepm_sddl_so_invoice_header`**.
![Image depicting step8-CdsAssociations](step8-CdsAssociations.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Add fields from existing associations)]
You will now add fields of related data sources to the SELECT list of `Z_Invoice_Items`, using the associations in path expressions. Each element in the path expression must be separated by a period.

  1.	Add the `company_name` of the business partner to the SELECT list using the associations **header** and **buyer** in a path expression
  2.  You will get an error, "Field header must be included in the selection list together with field `SEPM_SDDL_SO_INVOICE_ITEM.SALES_ORDER_INVOICE_KEY`". Resolve this by adding the field **`sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item.sales_order_invoice_key`** to the Select statement.
  3.	Add the `payment_status` from the invoice header to the SELECT list using the association **header**

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Add a CASE statement)]
If the invoice has been paid, you want to set the `payment_status` to X (true). Do this by implementing a CASE statement

```ABAP
case header.payment_status
    when 'P' then 'X'
    else ' '
end as payment_status
```

![Image depicting step10-CaseStatement](step10-CaseStatement.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Add a WHERE clause)]
You will now filter the results so that only invoice items with `currency_code = 'EUR'` are retrieved.

  1. Add a WHERE clause:
```ABAP
WHERE currency_code = 'EUR'
```
  ![Image depicting step12-WHERE](step12-WHERE.png)

  2. Save and activate the data definition by choosing **Save** (`Ctrl+S`) and **Activate** (`Ctrl+F3`).
  ![Image depicting step14-saveAndActivate](step14-saveAndActivate.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Check your code and view your changes)]
Your CDS view should look like this:

```ABAP
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZINVOICEITEMS2'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'CDS View for "Use-cds-view" tutorial'
define view Z_Invoice_Items_2
  as select from sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item
{
  //sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item

  header.buyer.company_name,
  sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item.sales_order_invoice_key,
  sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item.currency_code,
  sepm_sddl_so_invoice_item.gross_amount,

  case header.payment_status
  when 'P' then 'X'
  else ' '
  end

  as payment_status,

//* Associations *//
  header
}

where currency_code = 'EUR'
```
Open the CDS View in the Data Preview by choosing **F8**. Your CDS View should look like this:
