### You will learn  
Learn how to import a completed and published prototype from BUILD into SAP Web IDE. This will help you convert your prototype into a live application. This will be your guide or template for creating the real UI5/Fiori version.

> Please note that an imported BUILD prototype should not be used for a production application. The version of BUILD used in these tutorials is for prototyping and designing purposes only. The code generated is not optimized for performance and security. Stay tuned to BUILD for updates about BUILD Apps, a drag and drop tool to create production ready applications!
