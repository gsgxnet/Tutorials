[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Prepare the ABAP perspective)]

Make sure that your Eclipse Framework is opened in the ABAP perspective and that you are in the project explorer tab. From there expand the folder `$TMP-SHA` (see 1 in the screenshot). Next, expand the subfolder **Data Core Services** and select **Data Definitions**. From there,  right-click on **Data Definitions**, and in the opened  ABAP Repository Object window, select **DDL Source** and click **Enter**.

In the new window **DDL Source** (Create a DDL Source), the Project is called `S4H_100_sha_en` and the Package is called`$TMP`  (see 1 in the screenshot below). Enter  `ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY` as the Name (2 in the screenshot),  Airline `Query, public view, VDM consumption view` (3 in the screenshot) as Description and press **Finish**.

In the new window **DDL Source** (**Templates Select one of the available templates**), select **Define View** and click **Finish**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Generate code for the view)]


Code for the new created view named `ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY` is generated:

![Create the consumption view](BuildConsumptionView3_1.png)

In the generated code, we will replace `data source name` `(2)` with  `zxshI_Airline`, `#CHECK`  `(3)` with `NOT_REQUIRED`, `sql_view_name` `(4)`
 with `ZXSCHAIRLINEEQ` and `Airline Query ...` `(6)` with `Airline`. Save the changes.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add annotations)]


Insert two new annotations: a VDM Annotation and an OData Annotation
to the generated code:

First, insert a new line after line 4 with the following text:
   `@VDM.ViewType: #CONSUMPTION`

![Enhance the consumption view](BuildConsumptionView5_EnhanceCoding_VDMTyp.png)

Insert a  new line after line 5 with the following text:
   `@OData.publish: true`

![Enhancement consumption view with OData annotation ](BuildConsumptionView7_Enhance_OdataAnnotation.png)

Finally,  save the changes.


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Insert all columns of the interface view)]


Next, enhance the code by inserting the interface view (`zxshI_Airline`) columns. To achieve this, position the mouse pointer before the bracket near the view name `zxshI_Airline`, press **Ctrl + Space bar**. Within the displayed window select **insert all elements** and press **Enter**.

![Enhance the consumption view with  column selection](BuildConsumptionView7_EnhanceColumSelection.png)

Save and activate the modifications.

![Activate and save the Consumption view ](BuildConsumptionView8_AtferSave_Activate.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Resolve error)]

After the activation , an error is shown on the coding editor  due to a missing key.

![Error after trying to save the view](BuildConsumptionView10_ErrorAfterActivationKeyMissing.png)

If you hover on the error a window with the error cause will be displayed.

![Error message  after trying to save the view](ErrorMessage.png)

To resolve the error, define a key.

![Define the first column of the view as key ](DefineFirstColumEltAsKey.png)

Save and activate the changes and then hover again as shown below.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Check complete code)]

You can copy this content from here and paste it to the code editor of your ABAP perspective as well, instead of enhancing the generated code and typing it on your own:

```abap
    @AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZXSHCAIRLINEQ'
    @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
    @EndUserText.label: 'Airline'
    @VDM.viewType: #CONSUMPTION
    @OData.publish: true
    define view ZxshC_Airlinequery as select from ZxshI_Airline {
    key ZxshI_Airline.Airline,
    ZxshI_Airline.AirlineLocalCurrency,
    ZxshI_Airline.AirlineURL
    }
```
