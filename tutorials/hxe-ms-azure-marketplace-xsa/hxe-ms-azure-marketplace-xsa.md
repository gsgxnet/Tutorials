![deployment finished](success.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Connect to your virtual machine using SSH)]

Take note of your external IP address:

![Note IP address](IP.png)

- If you are using a **Windows** computer, you will need to download an SSH client [such as `PuTTY`](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php#putty).

      In `PuTTY`, add the IP to the Host field and click **OK**:

      ![IP in PuTTY](ssh.png)

      >Note: If you chose to use an SSH key as an authentication method, you will need to add it in `SSH->Auth`

- If you are using an **Apple** computer, open a terminal (`Finder -> Applications -> Terminal`)

      Run the following command in the terminal, replacing the username and IP by the one in your virtual machine:

      ```SSH
      ssh <<my_username>>@<<your_IP>>
      ```
      ![SSH in Mac](ssh2.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Setup your machine)]

From the SSH console, enter the following command:

```SSH
  sudo su - hxeadm
```

You will be prompted for a password for the administration users. **Read the rules** carefully before selecting one:

> ### **Note: Please check the password policy to avoid errors**
>
> SAP HANA, express edition requires a very strong password that complies with these rules:
>
> - At least 8 characters
> - At least 1 uppercase letter
> - At least 1 lowercase letter
> - At least 1 number
> - Can contain special characters, but not _&grave;_ (backtick), _&#36;_ (dollar sign),  _&#92;_ (backslash), _&#39;_ (single quote), or _&quot;_ (double quotes)
> - Cannot contain dictionary words
> - Cannot contain simplistic or systematic values, like strings in ascending or descending numerical or alphabetical order

&nbsp;

You will also be asked if you want to wait for the configuration to finish. It is advised to choose **No** for the installation to run in the background and not be interrupted in case of connectivity issues.

You can check the status of the installation using the command `cat /usr/sap/HXE/home/xsa_config_status`

![Configuration in process](xsa.png)

Once the configuration is finished, you will see the following message:

![Configuration successful](finished.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Map the hosts file)]

Use your IP address to map it to the hosts file in your computer. You need administration permissions to do this.

- For Windows Computers:
  If your user is not an administrator but has administrator rights, right-click on Notepad and choose `Run as Administrator`. If you are an administrator user, proceed to the next point.

  ![run notepad as admin](9.png)

  Open the file or navigate with Windows explorer. You need to edit the file called `hosts` in the directory `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

  ![Hosts file](8.png)


- For Mac OS:
  Open a terminal (`Finder -> Applications -> Terminal`) and type `sudo nano /etc/hosts`

  ![Hosts file](mac.jpg)


Add the IP address followed by the name of the host, `hxehost`:

![Hosts file](10.png)

**Save** and close the editor.

> Note: If Notepad asks you to create a new file you do not have enough permissions to save the file. Creating a new file will not alter the configuration as intended.

</br>

You can test you have successfully modified your configuration by entering the following URL in your browser: `https://hxehost:39030/`

![test XS Advanced](110.png)

>If you get a privacy error, continue browsing. The error is related to using a self-signed certificate.

You an use the link to the Web IDE (`https://hxehost:53075/`) to open it

>Note: If you get a **503 error - service unavailable**, the service is probably still starting. Try again in a couple of minutes.

Log in with `XSA_DEV` and the master password. You will see the Web IDE.

![test web ide](12.png)

You can now start to use your SAP HANA, express edition. The additional steps in this tutorial are only required if you are using additional components.

You can get started with your [first end-to-end XS Advanced application](https://www.sap.com/developer/groups/hana-xsa-get-started.html) or [explore additional tutorials at the Developer Center](https://www.sap.com/developer/topics/sap-hana-express.tutorials.html).


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7 (Optional): ](Change the password for the operating system user)]

The default password for the operating system administration user is `HXEHana1`. You can change it to one of your choice.

Open a **new SSH session** and log in with user `hxeadm`. You will be automatically prompted to change your password.

![Change password](change_password.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8 (Optional): ](Install SHINE or Enterprise Designer)]

If you chose the **XS Advanced** applications, you can install additional components. These components are **OPTIONAL** and independent among themselves.

Open a new console and log in with your MS Azure id. Go into the `Downloads` folder and list the contents.

```
cd /Downloads
ls
```

You will find the installation packages for the Enterprise Architecture Designer  (`eadesigner.tgz`) and the SAP HANA Interactive Education (SHINE, `shine.tgz`).

![Downloads folder](downloads_folder.png)

To install any of these packages, change permissions and decompress it first with the following command:

```
sudo chmod 777 -R <<compressed_file>>
sudo tar -xvzf <<name of the file>>

```

For example:

![Downloads](decompress.png)

Switch to user `hxeadm`. Go into the decompressed folder and execute the installation script you want.

```
sudo su hxeadm
cd /Downloads/HANA_EXPRESS_20
```
</br>
![switch user](15.png)


Execute `install_eadesigner.sh` if you want to install the Enterprise Architecture Designer:


```
./install_eadesigner.sh
```

For example:

![EA designer](eadesigner.png)

If you want to know the URLs to connect to the Enterprise Designer, type `xs apps`:

![Check EA](eadesigner1.png)

And/or `install_shine.sh` to install SHINE:

```
./install_shine.sh
```
For example:

![install shine](shine.png)

Make sure installation is successful when finished.

![deployment successful](success.png)

You can find more information on the SHINE module in the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP/hana-shine-xsa)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9 (Optional): ](Install Smart Data Streaming)]

Open a new SSH console and log in as you MS Azure VM user ID. Find out your internal IP address with the following command:

```
sudo ifconfig
```

Once the IP is shown, take note of it:

![IF Config](ifconfig.png)

And map it in the hosts file in your virtual machine:

```
sudo edit /etc/hosts
```

A text-editor will open. Use the arrow keys to move to where `127.0.0.2` is. Once there, press letter `i` to enter insert mode. Use the Delete key to delete IP `127.0.0.1` and enter your internal IP:

![change hosts name](vi.png)

Once you are finished editing, press `Esc` and write `:wq` to save your changes. If you want to discard your changes, you can use `:!q`

![change hosts name](vi2.png)

Back in the console prompt, navigate to the Downloads folder, extract the installation files:

```
cd /Downloads
sudo tar -xvzf sa.tgz
```

![untar file](tar_sa.png)

Once finished, execute the installation script. Be sure to enter **`hxehost`** as the name of the host when prompted:

```
sudo ./HANA_EXPRESS_20/install_sa.sh
```

As follows:

![execute](sds.png)

Once finished, you can verify it is running with the following command
```
ps -ef | grep streaming
```

![check streaming](sds_ok.png)

You can later enable a link to the tool from the SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA:
