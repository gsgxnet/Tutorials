[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Download the Command Line interface)]

Download the latest Command Line Interface (CLI) from the Cloud Foundry web site.  Use the following URL:  [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads).

On the Cloud Foundry website, choose either the command line installer (if you are set up to use one), or the binary from the table listed on the webpage.  If you don't know which to use, choose the installer (not the binary) for your Operating System from the table.

Open the installer on your computer, and follow the installation instructions.

> For more help with the CLI installation, look at the [Cloud Foundry CLI installation documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Test the Cloud Foundry CLI)]

Open a command prompt on your computer.  

> In Windows, you can search in the start menu for the application "command prompt".  
> On a Mac, use spotlight to find the application "terminal".  
> On Linux/Unix, you know how this works, just open your favorite command shell.

Next, test the Cloud Foundry command line interface to make certain it is installed correctly.

To test the CLI, type in the following:

    cf

You should see a list of Cloud Foundry commands.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Determine your Cloud Foundry URL)]

First, find the correct API URL for your region.  Select the correct region from this table, and copy the URL.  You will use the URL in the next steps to connect to Cloud Foundry.  

| Region                                          | URL                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------     |
| US East (VA) running on Amazon AWS              | `https://api.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com`     |
| US West (CA) running on Microsoft Azure         | `https://api.cf.us20.hana.ondemand.com`     |
| **Europe (Frankfurt) running on Amazon AWS**    | **`https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`** |
| Europe (Netherlands) running on Microsoft Azure | `https://api.cf.eu20.hana.ondemand.com`     |

> If your region is not in this list, check the [Regions and API endpoints list](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html#loiof344a57233d34199b2123b9620d0bb41) for the most up to date list.
