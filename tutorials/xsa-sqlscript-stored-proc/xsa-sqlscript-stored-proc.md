## Details
### You will learn  
In this exercise you will create a small procedure `get_po_header_data` with two implicit SELECT queries.
**Please note - This tutorial is based on SPS11**


---


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create new procedure)]

Right click on the **procedures** package and choose **New**, then **HDB Procedure**.

![New Procedure](1.png)

Enter the name of the procedure as `get_po_header_data`.  Click **Create**

![Create](2.png)

The editor will then be shown.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Change namespace name)]

Change the namespace from "Undefined" to `dev602.procedures`

![Namespace](4.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add SELECTs)]

Between the BEGIN and END statements, insert the SELECT statements as shown.  These are implicit select statements whose results sets are passed to the caller.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Review complete code)]

The completed code should look similar to this. If you do not wish to type this code, you can reference the solution web page at `http://<hostname>:51013/workshop/admin/ui/exerciseMaster/?workshop=dev602&sub=ex2_10`
```PROCEDURE "dev602.procedures::get_po_header_data" ( )LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPTSQL SECURITY INVOKER--DEFAULT SCHEMA <default_schema_name>READS SQL DATA ASBEGINSELECT COUNT(*) AS CREATE_CNT, "HISTORY.CREATEDBY.EMPLOYEEID"     FROM "dev602.data::PO.Header" WHERE PURCHASEORDERID IN (                     SELECT PURCHASEORDERID                          FROM "dev602.data::PO.Item"          WHERE "PRODUCT.PRODUCTID" IS NOT NULL)GROUP BY  "HISTORY.CREATEDBY.EMPLOYEEID";SELECT COUNT(*) AS CHANGE_CNT, "HISTORY.CHANGEDBY.EMPLOYEEID"     FROM "dev602.data::PO.Header"  WHERE PURCHASEORDERID IN (                     SELECT PURCHASEORDERID                          FROM "dev602.data::PO.Item"          WHERE "PRODUCT.PRODUCTID" IS NOT NULL)GROUP BY  "HISTORY.CHANGEDBY.EMPLOYEEID";END```


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Save and build)]

Save the procedure.

![Save](7.png)

Perform a build on your `hdb` module.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Invoke procedure)]

Switch over to the HRTT page and look for your procedure

![HRTT](9.png)

Right-click on the procedure and choose **Invoke Procedure**.

![Invoke Procedure](10.png)

A new SQL tab will be opened with the CALL statement inserted.  

![SQL tab](11.png)

Click the **Run** button.

![Run](12.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Check results)]

The two results are then shown in another tab.

Note the execution time.
