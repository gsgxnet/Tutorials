Open the file `/etc/hosts` in Mac or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` in MS Windows. Add the external front end IP Address and `vhcala4hci vhcala4hci.dummy.nodomain`

```
<<IP address>>  vhcala4hci vhcala4hci.dummy.nodomain
```

For example:

>Hint: If you cannot save your changes into the hosts file, try running Notepad as administrator and opening the file from there.

You can use the hostname as your SAP GUI entry and Eclipse ADT plugin
