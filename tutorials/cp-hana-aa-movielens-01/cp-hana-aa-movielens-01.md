[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Info: ](Which MovieLens dataset?)]

In order to build your movie recommendation engine, we will be using one of the `MovieLens` dataset, as there are multiple one with different sizes.

These datasets are made available by the <a href="https://grouplens.org" target="new">```GroupLens``` Research &copy;</a> group. They have collected and made available rating data sets from the <a href="http://movielens.org" target="new">```MovieLens```</a> web site which were collected over various periods of time.

The data set that we will be using for this series is the ***small*** version of the **`MovieLens` Latest Datasets** downloadable <a href="http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/" target="new">here</a>.

This dataset, thanks to its size, can easily be used with your SAP HANA MDC instance on the SAP Cloud Platform developer/trial account.

If you have a SAP Cloud Platform productive account with a larger SAP HANA instance, you can run this tutorial series with the larger datasets, but the validations steps implemented were built based on the "small dataset".

Before using these data sets, please review the <a href="http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html" target="new">README</a> file for the usage licenses and other details.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Info: ](SAP HANA import options)]

There are multiple ways to import data like the `MovieLens` flat files inside of your SAP HANA instance on the SAP Cloud Platform.

- ***Eclipse IDE***

For example, there is an ***Import/Export*** feature provided by the ***SAP HANA*** plugin for the ***Eclipse IDE*** which would allow you to create the appropriate physical tables and then import the data.

However, this would require the ***Eclipse IDE*** to be locally installed and properly configured with the ***SAP HANA*** plugin.

Then, you would need to know the complete file format description in order to create the tables with the proper columns structure. And any changes would require to recreate the all structure and reload the data.

- ***SAP HANA Persistence Model***

SAP HANA Extended Application Services (SAP HANA XS) enables you to create database schema, tables, views, and sequences as design-time files in the repository.

When implementing the data persistence model, you can use either the ***Core Data Services (CDS)*** syntax or ***`HDBtable`*** syntax (or both).

The ***`HDBtable`*** syntax is a collective term which includes the different configuration schema for each of the various design-time data artifacts, for example: schema (`.hdbschema`), sequence (`.hdbsequence`), table (`.hdbtable`), and view (`.hdbview`).

This is why we will be using the SAP HANA ***`HDBtable`*** syntax including ***Core Data Service*** (CDS) artifacts instead, which only requires the ***SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench*** available with any SAP HANA MDC on the ***SAP Cloud Platform***. All the objects will be created as ***design-time*** and will  allow us to adapt the structure easily without reloading the data.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Create the package structure)]

Select the **Content** node from the tree, then right click on it and select **Create Application**.

Enter **`public.aa.movielens`** as your application package, then click on **Create**.

> **Note**: Make sure that the **Content** node is the item selected in the tree, else the package will be created under the currently selected tree node

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Create the Design-Time Schema)]

>
>A **schema** defines the container that holds database objects such as tables, views, and stored procedures. You need a schema to be able to write to the catalog.
>
>To create a database schema as a design-time object, you have to create a flat file that contains the schema definition and save this file with the suffix `.hdbschema` in the appropriate package for your application in the SAP HANA repository.

Create a new file named **`MOVIELENS.hdbschema`** in the **`public/aa/movielens/hdb`** package with the following content:

```JavaScript
schema_name="MOVIELENS";
```

Save the file using the ![plus](0-save.png) icon from the menu or press `CTRL+S`.

Check the message console, and make sure there is no errors. The following messages should be displayed:

```
[xx:xx:xx] File /public/aa/movielens/hdb/MOVIELENS.hdbschema created successfully.
[xx:xx:xx] File /public/aa/movielens/hdb/MOVIELENS.hdbschema saved & activated successfully.
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Create the Design-Time Role)]

> **Design-Time Role**
>
>The design-time definition of a role allows you to transport easily all the authorization that you want to apply for your application.
>
For example, you can implement a role that grant access to design-time object like specific CDS entities and even run-time privileges.
>
This provides a lot of flexibility in term of authorization management. They are specified in a text file with the extension `.hdbrole`.

Create a new file named **`user.hdbrole`** in the **`public/aa/movielens/hdb`** package.

By default, the ***Role Editor*** will open by default, but instead we will be using the ***Text Editor***, so you can close the ***Role Editor***.

Instead, right click on the **`user.hdbrole`** item in the tree, and use the **Open With** > **Text Editor** menu.

Now, paste the following content:

```JavaScript
role public.aa.movielens.hdb::user extends catalog role "sap.pa.apl.base.roles::APL_EXECUTE", "AFLPM_CREATOR_ERASER_EXECUTE", "AFL__SYS_AFL_AFLPAL_EXECUTE"
{
    schema public.aa.movielens.hdb:MOVIELENS.hdbschema: SELECT, EXECUTE, CREATE ANY;
}
```

Here we have added the required roles and privileges to run our predictive algorithm scripts.

Save the file using the ![plus](0-save.png) icon from the menu or press `CTRL+S`.

Check the message console, and make sure there is no errors. The following messages should be displayed:

```
[xx:xx:xx] File /public/aa/movielens/hdb/user.hdbrole created successfully.
[xx:xx:xx] File /public/aa/movielens/hdb/user.hdbrole saved & activated successfully.
```

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Create the CDS Artifacts)]

> **CDS Artifacts**
>
>CDS Artifacts are the objects that make up your persistence model, for example: contexts, entities, structured types, and views.
>
>They are stored in a CDS documents which are design-time source files that contain DDL code according to rules defined in Core Data Services.
>
>CDS documents have the file suffix `.hdbdd`. Each CDS document must contain the following basic elements:
><li> Name space declaration: The name space you define must be the first declaration in the CDS document and match the absolute package path to the location of the CDS document in the repository. It is possible to enclose parts of the name space in quotes (""), for example, to solve the problem of illegal characters in name spaces.</li>
><li> CDS artifact definitions: The objects that make up your persistence model, for example: contexts, entities, structured types, and views</li>

Create a new file named **`data.hdbdd`** in the **`public/aa/movielens/hdb`** package with the following content:

```JavaScript
namespace public.aa.movielens.hdb;

@Schema : 'MOVIELENS'
context "data"  {
  @Catalog.tableType : #COLUMN
  Entity LINKS {
    key MOVIEID : Integer;
    IMDBID      : Integer;
    TMDBID      : Integer;

> **Table-Import Configuration**
>
>SAP HANA Extended Application Services (SAP HANA XS) enables you to perform data-provisioning operations that you define in a design-time configuration file.
>
>The configuration file is transportable, which means you can transfer the data-provisioning between SAP HANA systems quickly and easily.
>
>The table-import configuration enables you to specify how data from a comma-separated-value (`.csv`) file is imported into a target table in SAP HANA.
>
>The configuration specifies the source file containing the data values to import and the target table in SAP HANA into which the data must be inserted.
>
>As further options, you can specify which field delimiter to use when interpreting data in the source `.csv` file and if keys must be used to determine which columns in the target table to insert the imported data into.

Create a new file named **`data.hdbti`** in the **`public/aa/movielens/hdb`** package with the following content:

```JavaScript
import = [

Now, we need to grant the ***design-time*** role we created previously to our ***`MOVIELENS_USER`*** user so that you can get access to the data and run the algorithm scripts.
