[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

Open the Xcode project for your app. Notice the added `InfoPlist.strings` and `Localizable.strings` files for the languages you have selected for translation:

![Add translations](fiori-ios-scpms-custom-app-translation-11.png)

While most translations seem right, some may not be translated correctly.

Although you can fix this from within the file itself, it may be more convenient to change it in the **SAP Translation Hub** web app.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Modify the generated translations)]

Navigate to **Services > SAP Translation Hub** in your SAP Cloud Platform trial account and click the **Go to UI for Translation Workflow** link at the bottom. The **SAP Translation Hub** web interface will open in a new tab. you will now see the just added `espmreminders` project:

![Add translations](fiori-ios-scpms-custom-app-translation-13.png)

Here you can correct any translations that may be incorrect, and click the **Save Project** button once done.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Localize the application name)]

You may have noticed the texts containing `$(PRODUCT_NAME)` are changed to `(PRODUCT_NAME) $`. You may change it back, but you could also provide a proper, translated name for your app.

Check the **Source Texts** which lists `$(PRODUCT_NAME)`, and provide a translated app name instead. Click the **Save Project** button when done.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Re-import the modified translations)]

Open the **SDK Assistant**, right-click the `ESPMReminders` app and from the context menu, select **Add translation...**. Select the same languages from the list you have chosen in **Step 4**, and click the **Add** button.

Once finished, open your Xcode project and notice the modified translations:

![Add translations](fiori-ios-scpms-custom-app-translation-14.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Enable your app for localized app name)]
