## Prerequisites  
- **Proficiency:** Beginner


## Details
### You will learn  
- How to configure your project for running a Grunt build
- How to run a Grunt build

SAP Web IDE Full-stack now comes with the Grunt task runner already part of the IDE, so you can run tasks by:

- Specifying dependencies in the `package.json` file.
- Specifying/defining tasks in the `Gruntfile.js` file.  

Once you've created these files, you get a new menu option called **Build** to start the grunt tasks. You don't specify a task; SAP Web IDE always runs the `default` task that you have defined in the `Gruntfile.js`.

### Before you begin
For this tutorial, make sure:

- You are using **SAP Web IDE Full-stack**
- You have created an SAPUI5 project. You can simply create a blank or sample project from a template.
- Your project uses the Basic JavaScript validator. To change it, right-click your project and go to **Project Settings** | **Code Checking** | **JavaScript**, change the validator to **Basic JavaScript**, and click **Save**.

The `grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build` Grunt plugin is published on the SAP npm registry. To run the Grunt build using this plugin outside of SAP Web IDE for Full-Stack Development, such as from a CLI as part of the CI process, use npm version 5.7.1 or later and add the following configuration option to the npm configuration file:

`@sap:registry=https://npm.sap.com/`

For more information, see <https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc>.



### Time to Complete
**10 Min**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a package.json file)]
Right-click your project and choose **New** | **File**, enter `package.json`.

![Create package.json](grunt-Step1-newfile.png)

In the file enter the following code:
```
{
  "name": "grunt-build",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Grunt build",
  "private": true,
  "devDependencies": {
      "@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build": "1.3.62"
   }
}
```
![Create package.json](grunt-Step1-newfile2.png)


Later, when you select **Build** in the context menu, these settings instruct npm to install Grunt and the `gruntsapui5-bestpractice-build` Grunt plugin that contains tasks for building your SAPUI5 project.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a Gruntfile.js file)]
Right-click your project and choose **New** | **File**, enter `Gruntfile.js`.

![Create Gruntfile.js](grunt-Step2-newfile.png)

In the file enter the following code:
```
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  'use strict';
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build');
  grunt.registerTask('default', [
      'lint',
      'clean',
      'build'
  ]);
};
```

The code does the following:

- Loads the tasks from the SAPUI5 best practices Grunt plugin.
- Sets the default task to execute the following tasks defined in the SAPUI plugin:

|Task&nbsp;&nbsp;            |Description       |
|---------------|-------|
| `lint`        | Validates the project code using ESLint according to the rules defined in the `.eslintrc` configuration file located in the root of your project.      |
| `clean`       | Cleans the `dist` target folder from the previous build results.      |
| `build`       | Produces a new build output in the `dist` folder of your project that is ready and optimized for better performance in the productive environment. The following tasks are executed during the build:<ul><li>Minification of `.css` files</li><li>Minification of JavaScript files (minified files)</li><li>Copying of the original files to the dist folder with `-dbg` suffix added for debugging purposes</li><li>Generation of the `Component-preload.js` and `Component-preload-dbg.js` preload files for the debug and minified files</li><li>Minification of the preload file</li><li>Generation of the `CachebusterInfo.json` file</li><li>Generation of the `changes-bundle.json` file. The file contains a collection of all the changes that are made to an SAP Fiori element application and are located in the changes folder.</li></ul> |

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Build your project)]
Right-click your project and choose **Build**.
![Create package.json](grunt-Step3-build.png)

When the build finishes, a new `dist` folder is created in your project and is automatically added to `.gitignore`, ensuring that the folder is not checked into the project's Git repository.
![Create package.json](grunt-Step3-dist.png)

You can see any build errors in the console, which you can display by going to **View** | **Console**.
![Create package.json](grunt-Step3-console.png)

>A new `package-lock.json` file is added to your project (unless it already existed). It is a special file that `npm` uses for locking the version of each package in the dependency tree, including the final resolved versions of ranges such as ~1.7.0 or ^1.0.9. If your project is connected to Git, commit and push the file to your Git repository.

>**Tip**
>If the build fails, do one of the following according to the failure reported in the console:
>
>  - **ERROR**: `Unable to locate local Grunt`
>Right-click the project folder in the workspace, select **Clean npm Folder**, and build again.
This option removes the node-modules folder that is automatically created by npm. For more information, see <https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders>. After the build finishes, this folder is not displayed in your project, but is stored by the SAP Web IDE build infrastructure.
  - **ERROR**: `npm ERR! code EINTEGRITY`
  Delete your `package-lock.json` file from the project and run the build again.
