## Prerequisites  
 - **Proficiency:** Beginner
 - **Tutorials:** [Install Postman Rest Client](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/api-tools-postman-install.html)
 - Access to a tenant specific to SAP IoT Application Enablement. In this tutorial, tenant `sap-iotaehandson2` is used.

## Details
### You will learn  
In [previous tutorials](https://www.sap.com/developer/groups/iotae-computer-as-thing.html), you learned about using Thing Modeler to onboard a computer as the IoT thing, send data to the thing, and retrieve data from the thing. Now, you'll learn to use Postman to access SAP IoT Application Enablement service APIs.

### Application Router
Access to SAP IoT Application Enablement is usually routed through an application router as the single entry point for consumers. The application router handles the user authentication against **SAP User Account and Authentication Service (UAA)**. In addition, the service retains the generated JWT token for the duration of the client logon session. You can define multiple application routers per tenant and you can use one of the router to access IoT Application Enablement services.

### Tenant-specific Application Router
SAP IoT Application Enablement offers tenant-specific application router to access the different backend services such as configuration, business partner, and thing services. For example, you can access the configuration services for the tenant `sap-iotaehandson2` using the application router URL <https://sap-iotaehandson2.iot-sap.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/appcore-conf/Configuration>.

The following illustrates the different parts of tenant-specific application router:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:--------------|
|`sap-iotaehandson2`|Tenant name|
|`iot-sap`|Name of the application router used to access IoT Application Enablement services|
|`cfapps.eu10`|Technology and the region|
|`appcore-conf`|Name of the application you are accessing using the application router|
|`Configuration`|API endpoint you are accessing within the application|

For more information about the authorization concept of the SAP IoT Application Enablement platform, see <https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_IOT_APPLICATION_SERVICES> | **SAP IoT Application Enablement Services** | **Authorization**.
