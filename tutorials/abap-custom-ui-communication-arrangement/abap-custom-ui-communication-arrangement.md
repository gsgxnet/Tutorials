## Prerequisites
- **Tutorials:** [`Create OAuth communication system and user`](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/abap-custom-ui-communication-systems.html)
- **Authorizations:** The assignment of the business catalog **`SAP_CORE_BC_COM`** represents the prerequisites for the usage of communication arrangement.


## Details
### You will learn
- How to create a communication arrangement for SAP Web IDE scenario `SAP_COM_0013`
- How to create a HTTP destination
- How to create a UI project

You will learn how to enable SAP Cloud Platform development with SAP Web IDE against a specific S/4HANA system via OAuth authentication. You will see that communication arrangement for SAP Web IDE scenario `SAP_COM_0013` in S/4HANA will expose essential services, that SAP Web IDE needs. SAP Cloud Platform subaccount will get a destination which holds data for the connection and OAuth communication with the S/4HANA system. At the end you will see in SAP Web IDE a list of services that you can theoretically build extensions on.

### Time to Complete
**15 Min**.
