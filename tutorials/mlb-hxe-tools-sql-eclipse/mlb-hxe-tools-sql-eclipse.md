## Details
### You will learn
In this tutorial, you will install and configure the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse.

Then, you will learn how to connect to the System database and the HXE tenant of your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

For alternate options, you can also check the following link: [Select a SQL query tool for SAP HANA, express edition](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/mlb-hxe-tools-sql.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Prerequisite: ](Eclipse IDE)]

In order to proceed with the next steps, you must have the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) installed, running and properly connected to the internet.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Info: ](Gather your system details)]

In order to connect to your SAP HANA, express edition, you will need to specify the following details:

### **Host name**

You can specify either the host IP address or its fully qualified name of your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

You can usually retrieve the IP address running the following command directly from the SAP HANA, express edition host:

```Shell
/sbin/ifconfig
```

> ### **Note**:
> &nbsp;
> When connecting to an SAP HANA, express edition instance hosted in the cloud, the IP address returned by the above command represents your local IP address, which may not be exposed on the internet.
> &nbsp;
> In order to connect, you will need to retrieve the host ***external IP address***. Refer to your cloud provider documentation to retrieve this information.
>
&nbsp;

Make sure that you can ***`ping`*** the host IP address or its fully qualified name from the computer you will connect using Eclipse.

We encourage you to update your local host file and add an entry to map the SAP HANA, express edition host IP address to a local name.

### **Instance number**

The instance number used by default value is **90**, unless specified otherwise during the setup.

In earlier releases (prior to version 1.0 SPS12), the default value was **00**, unless specified otherwise during the setup.

> ### **Note**:
> &nbsp;
> The ***instance number*** has a direct impact on the TCP port numbers, and therefore the firewall configuration.
> &nbsp;
> The pattern used for the port number is: **3&lt;instance number&gt;&lt;service port&gt;**.
&nbsp;
> For example, the ***SQL/MDX*** service port to access the ***system database*** of a multitenant system is **13**. It means that TCP port **39013** will be used to connect to the SYSTEMDB to run ***SQL/MDX***.
&nbsp;

Make sure that you can reach the port (using a telnet command) from the computer you will connect using Eclipse.

### **Mode**

Prior to version 1.0 SPS12, SAP HANA, express edition was delivered using a *single-database container* mode which uses the **Single Container** mode.

But since version 2.0, SAP HANA, express edition uses a *multi-database container* architecture.

During the installation process, a *System database* named ***`SYSTEMDB`*** along with a *tenant database* named ***HXE*** are created.

Therefore, you will use the **Multiple Container** mode, and then decide to connect to either the ***System database*** or a ***Tenant database*** using its name.

### **Credentials**

By default, a ***SYSTEM*** user is always created with every ***System database*** or ***Tenant database***.

Most installation will force you to setup a new password either upon the first start of the virtual machine (also referred as ***HANA Database Master*** password), during the setup with the manual binary installation or using a password configuration file with ***`Docker`***.

Make you have the proper credentials, as after 5 failed login attempts, the user account will be locked for 1440 minutes which is the database default password policy).

>
![image Step 3](03-1-docker.png)

We encourage you to set a **Description** as it will help identify in a more meaningful manner your instances.

For example, you can include the host name and the instance number which are not displayed afterward.

Click on **Next**.

Select **Authentication by database user**.

Enter your database credentials, usually with the **SYSTEM** database user credentials.

Select if you want to **Store user name and password in a secure storage**.

Click on **Finish**

![image Step 3](03-2.png)

> ### **Note**:
>
> You may be asked to change the user password if this is the first login attempt.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Add a connection to the HXE tenant)]

Click on the **Add System...** ![add system](00-add-system.png) icon.

![image Step 4](00-add-system-menu.png)

> ### **Note**:
>
> The ***Add Cloud System...*** is no longer available with the Oxygen version of the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse.

Provide the following system details based on the ***Info: Gather your system details*** section.

Select **Multiple containers**, then select **Tenant database**, and enter **HXE** in the name field.

![image Step 4](04-1.png)

> ### **Warning**: For Docker image from the Docker store
> &nbsp;
> In order to connect to the HXE tenant, you will need to select then select **Tenant database**, and input **HXE:39041** in the name field. This is due to a specific port binding configuration.
>
![image Step 4](04-1-docker.png)

We encourage you to set a **Description** as it will help identify in a more meaningful manner your instances.

For example, you can include the host name and the instance number which are not displayed afterward.

Click on **Next**.

Select **Authentication by database user**.

Enter your database credentials, usually with the **SYSTEM** database user credentials.

Select if you want to **Store user name and password in a secure storage**.

Click on **Finish**

![image Step 4](04-2.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Analyze the connections)]

The new connections are displayed in the ***Systems*** view as shown below:

![image Step 5](05.png)

The green indicator ![connected](00-connected.png) informs you that all services are properly started.

When you are logger out, the icon will be greyed out like this ![logged off](00-not-logged.png).

When you cannot connect, either because the host is unreachable or the credentials are not valid, a red cross will be added like this ![cannot connect](00-cannot-connect.png). The grey dot reflect the fact that the services status cannot be checked.

The displayed information is following this pattern: **[Tenant name]@[Instance name] ([Database user name] [Description])**.

The instance name, which is by default HXE, is directly linked to the instance number, and not to be confused with the HXE database tenant.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Test the connections with SQL)]

Select the **HXE @ HXE (SYSTEM)** item, then click on the SQL icon ![sql](00-sql.png).

This will open a SQL console linked to the **HXE @ HXE (SYSTEM)** connection.

![image Step 6](06-1.png)

Execute the following SQL statement, by pasting the following content then press **F8** or click on the ![sql execute](00-sql-execute.png) icon:

```SQL
select DATABASE_NAME from M_DATABASES;
```

It should return the following result:

![image Step 6](06-2.png)

Now switch to the **SYSTEMDB @ HXE (SYSTEM)** connection, either by opening a new SQL console, or using the ***Switch connection*** ![sql](00-sql-switch.png) icon.

Run the same SQL statement again, and the result should be:

![image Step 6](06-3.png)

This implies that the tenant database cannot see the system database but the system database can.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Validation)]

By default the SAP HANA, express edition instance id is 90, but in fact Eclipse will request the full port number to the server when connection.

Right click on your **HXE @ HXE (SYSTEM)** connection, then select **Properties** (or press ALT+ENTER), then under **Database User Logon**, switch to the **Additional Properties**.

Provide an answer to the question below then click on **Validate**.
