## Prerequisites
 - [Use Machine Learning to Build a Movie Recommendation application using the XS advanced development model](https://www.sap.com/developer/groups/hxe-aa-movielens.html)

## Next Steps
 - [Use Machine Learning to Build a Movie Recommendation application using the XS advanced development model](https://www.sap.com/developer/groups/hxe-aa-movielens.html)

## Details
### You will learn
- How to create CDS artifacts to expose your dataset as CDS entities.
- How to load your dataset content in the CDS entities.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1:](Which MovieLens dataset?)]

In order to build your movie recommendation engine, you will be using one of the `MovieLens` dataset.

These datasets are made available by the <a href="https://grouplens.org" target="new">```GroupLens``` Research &copy;</a> group.

They have collected and made available movie rating data sets from the <a href="http://movielens.org" target="new">```MovieLens```</a> web site which were collected over various periods of time.

The data set that you will be using for this series is the ***small*** version of the **`MovieLens` Latest Datasets** downloadable <a href="http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/" target="new">here</a>.

This dataset, thanks to its size, can quickly be uploaded in your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

If you have additional capacity resources, you can run this tutorial series with the larger datasets, but the validations steps implemented were built based on the ***small dataset***.

Before using these data sets, please review the <a href="http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html" target="new">README</a> file for the usage licenses and other details.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1:](SAP HANA data import options)]

There are multiple ways to import data set files inside of your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

- ***Eclipse IDE***

The ***SAP HANA Tools*** plugin for Eclipse provides an ***Import/Export*** feature which would allow you to create the appropriate physical tables first and then import the data.

However, this would require the ***Eclipse IDE*** to be locally installed and properly configured with the ***SAP HANA Tools*** plugin.

Then, you would need to know the complete data file format description in order to create the tables with the proper columns structure. And, last but not least, any changes would require to recreate the all structure and reload the data.

If you want to learn more about this import method, you can check the following tutorial: [Import CSV into SAP HANA, express edition using the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/mlb-hxe-import-data-eclipse.html)

- ***SAP HANA HDB Client***

The **SAP HANA HDB Client** provides an ***IMPORT FROM*** statement allowing you to import CSV files physically located on your SAP HANA, express edition host using a SQL command.

However, this method requires that the table are created before the execution of the command.

If you want to learn more about this import method, you can check the following tutorial: [Import CSV into SAP HANA, express edition using IMPORT FROM SQL command](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/mlb-hxe-import-data-sql-import.html)

- ***SAP HANA Persistence Model***

The **SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model**, (XS advanced) provide a comprehensive platform for the development and execution of native data-intensive applications.

The application data model comprises all the database artifacts used to store and provision data for your application's back end and user interface.

As part of the process of defining the database persistence model for your application, you can create database design-time artifacts such as tables and views, for example using Core Data Services (CDS).

At the same time, you can also create procedures and functions using SQLScript, which can be used to insert data into (and remove data from) tables or views.

#### ***Solution***

As the purpose of this tutorial series is to discover how to use Machine Learning algorithms to build an end to end solution including a native SAP HANA application, you will be using the ***SAP HANA Persistence Model*** with the ***Core Data Service*** (CDS) artifacts in a ***SAP HANA Database Module***.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create the CDS Entity Artifacts)]

> #### **CDS Entities Artifacts**
>
>In the SAP HANA database, a CDS entity is a table with a set of data elements that are organized using columns and rows.
>&nbsp;
>A CDS entity has a specified number of columns, defined at the time of entity creation, but can have any number of rows.
>&nbsp;
>Database entities also typically have meta-data associated with them; the meta-data might include constraints on the entity or on the values within particular columns.
>&nbsp;
>SAP HANA Extended Application Services (SAP HANA XS) enables you to create a database entity as a design-time file. All design-time files, including your CDS entity definition, can be transported to other SAP HANA systems and, when deployed, used to generate the same catalog objects. You can define the entity using CDS compliant DDL.
>&nbsp;
>They are stored in a CDS documents which are design-time source files that contain DDL code according to rules defined in Core Data Services.
>&nbsp;
>The SAP HANA Core Data Services (CDS) plug-in transforms a design-time SAP HANA CDS resource (defined in a `.hdbcds` artifact) into the database objects defined in the CDS document, for example, tables, views, types, etc.
>&nbsp;
>For additional details, check the [CDS Entities in XS Advanced](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.03/en-US/df46a790f0694b0d9820487b385d138c.html) documentation.

Create a new file named **`data.hdbcds`** in the **`movielens/db/src/hdb`** folder.

By default the ***Graphical Editor*** will open. Close it, and right click on the **`data.hdbcds`** file, and go to **Open with > Code Editor**.

This is the full path of the created file:

```
movielens/db/src/hdb/data.hdbcds
```

Paste the following content:

```JavaScript
namespace aa.movielens.db.hdb;

context data {
    entity links {
        key MOVIEID : Integer;
            IMDBID  : Integer;
            TMDBID  : Integer;
    };

    entity movies {
        key MOVIEID : Integer;
            TITLE   : String(255);
            GENRES  : String(255);
    };

    entity ratings {
