SAP HANA, express edition is a streamlined version of the SAP HANA platform which enables developers to jump-start application development in the cloud or personal computer to build and deploy modern applications that use up to 32GB memory. SAP HANA, express edition includes the in-memory data engine with advanced analytical data processing engines for business, text, spatial, and graph data - supporting multiple data models on a single copy of the data.

The software license allows for both non-production and production use cases, enabling you to quickly prototype, demo, and deploy next-generation applications using SAP HANA, express edition without incurring any license fees. Memory capacity increases beyond 32GB are available for purchase at the [SAP Store](https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/99055/SAP-HANA%2C-express-edition).

SAP HANA, express edition for Docker has been tested on the following Linux operating system versions:

| Linux OS | OS Version | Docker Editions
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Ubuntu`  | `17.04 (Zesty Zapus)` | [Community](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-ubuntu),  [Enterprise](https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-ubuntu) |
| `openSUSE` | `openSUSE Leap` | [Enterprise](https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-sles) |
| `CentOS` | `7 (Core)` | [Community](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-centos),  [Enterprise](https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-centos) |
| `Debian` | `9 (Stretch)` | [Community](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-debian) |
| `Fedora` | `28 (Server Edition)` | [Community](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-fedora) |

**This installation does not support Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac.**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Install Docker)]

Download and install the appropriate Docker Edition for your system. Visit the [Docker Community Edition](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition) or [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=enterprise&type=edition) lists for more information and to download Docker for your machine.

> **Note:**
> Ensure your proxy settings have been properly set up. See [**HTTP/HTTPS proxy**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#httphttps-proxy) in the Docker documentation.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Log Into Docker)]

To log into your Docker account, run:

```
sudo docker login
```

Follow the prompts and provide your Docker ID and password.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ]((Optional) Test Your Docker Installation)]

Test your Docker installation by running the "Hello World" container application. Run the following command from your Docker-enabled command prompt:

```
sudo docker run --name helloWorld alpine echo hello
```

If successful, the following should display:

```
Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
88286f41530e: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:<log_number>
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
hello
```

If `hello` is printed, you have successfully pulled the container image **alpine** (a demo Linux distribution), and ran the instance of the container `helloWorld`, and ran the command `echo` with an input parameter of `hello`.

If you **did not** get this output, the Docker installation has not been completed or the Docker daemon can not connect to the internet. Review the process and check the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) for more information in troubleshooting your Docker installation.

Remove the alpine image with the following command:

```
sudo docker image rm alpine -f
```

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Download the SAP HANA, express edition Image from the Docker Library)]

Go to the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/).

Click on the search bar and search for "SAP HANA, express edition".

Choose **SAP HANA, express edition (database services)**.

![Docker Store](choose_docker.png)

Click on the **Setup Instructions** button.

Copy the Docker pull address. Here is an example:

```
sudo docker pull store/saplabs/hanaexpress:2.00.033.00.20180925.2
```

Open your Docker-enabled command line and use the Docker pull address to download the image.

This loads the SAP HANA, express edition image. To ensure that the image was loaded successfully, run:

```bash
sudo docker images
```

The SAP HANA, express edition image will be listed as `hanaexpress`.

> Note:
> You may have to log into your Docker account to pull the image. From your Docker-enabled command line, run `docker login` and follow the prompts to enter your Docker ID and password. Once you have logged in, try the pull command again.

[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Edit the host sysctl.conf file)]

Before you can start the container, ensure that the following parameters are set in your host's `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. The host can be a virtual machine, physical machine, or a cloud instance.

```
fs.file-max=20000000
fs.aio-max-nr=262144
vm.memory_failure_early_kill=1
vm.max_map_count=135217728
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range=40000 60999
```

To edit the `sysctl.conf` file, use the `vi` command to open the file and press `i` to switch to interactive mode. Edit the file as necessary, hit the `esc` key, and type and enter `:wq!` to write and save the changes.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ]((Optional) Create a Directory to Persist SAP HANA, express edition Data Outside of the Container)]

Create a directory for the SAP HANA, express edition container and grant it the proper permissions.  

```
mkdir -p /data/<directory_name>
chown 12000:79 /data/<directory_name>
```

The name of this directory does not need to match the name you give to your SAP HANA, express edition container.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Set Up Password for SAP HANA, express edition)]

To make your system more secure, you specify your own password before you create your container. This is done by creating a `json` file as opposed to having a default password. The file can be stored locally or on another system accessible by URL. If the file is to be stored locally, store it in the */data/<directory_name>* directory you created earlier.

Create the `json` file:

```
vi <file_name>.json
```

Press `i` to start editing and use one of the following formats to create the file:  

```
{
"master_password" : "<password>"
}  
```

or:  

```
{
"system_user_password" : "<password",
"default_tenant_system_user_password" : "<second_password>"
}
```

Here is an example:

```
{
  "master_password" : "HXEHana1"
}
```

Press `esc` and then enter `wq!` to write and save the file.

This file serves as the master password for your SAP HANA, express edition users. The password must comply with these rules:

* At least 8 characters
* At least 1 uppercase letter
* At least 1 lowercase letter
* At least 1 number
* Can contain special characters, but not _&grave;_ (backtick), _&#36;_ (dollar sign),  _&#92;_ (backslash), _&#39;_ (single quote), or _&quot;_ (double quotation marks).
* Cannot contain dictionary words
* Cannot contain simplistic or systemic values, like strings in ascending or descending numerical or alphabetical order

You must then add permissions for this file to be readable by the `hxeadm` user in the container. Change permissions with:

```
sudo chmod 600 /data/<directory_name>/<file_name>.json
sudo chown 12000:79 /data/<directory_name>/<file_name>.json
```

Be sure to do this with each `json` file you use for your Docker containers.

Make a note of the path to the `json` file. You will need this to load the SAP HANA, express edition container.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Start SAP HANA, express edition Container)]

Use the SAP HANA, express edition image to create a container.

```
sudo docker run -p 39013:39013 -p 39017:39017 -p 39041-39045:39041-39045 -p 1128-1129:1128-1129 -p 59013-59014:59013-59014 -v /data/<directory_name>:/hana/mounts \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
--sysctl kernel.shmmax=1073741824 \
--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range='40000 60999' \
--sysctl kernel.shmmni=524288 \
--sysctl kernel.shmall=8388608 \
--name <container_name> \
store/saplabs/hanaexpress:2.00.033.00.20180925.2 \
--passwords-url <file://<path_to_json_file> OR http/https://<url_to_json_file>> \
--agree-to-sap-license
```

Example:

```
sudo docker run -p 39013:39013 -p 39017:39017 -p 39041-39045:39041-39045 -p 1128-1129:1128-1129 -p 59013-59014:59013-59014 -v /data/express_edition:/hana/mounts \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
--sysctl kernel.shmmax=1073741824 \
--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range='40000 60999' \
--sysctl kernel.shmmni=524288 \
--sysctl kernel.shmall=8388608 \
--name express_edition \
store/saplabs/hanaexpress:2.00.033.00.20180925.2 \
--passwords-url file:///hana/password.json \
--agree-to-sap-license
```

This example creates the SAP HANA, express edition container with the name `express_edition`. This process will take several minutes. The prompt will read `Startup finished` once the container has been successfully running. This container starts in detached mode so you will need to open another command prompt to continue.  

> **Note:**
> If you placed the password file in `/data/<directory_name>/<file_name>.json`, substitute  `file://<path_to_json_file>` with `file:///hana/mounts/<file_name>.json`.

> **Note:**
> Check if the password file `/hana/mounts/<file_name>.json` was deleted after the SAP HANA, express edition container starts.  If not, you can manually delete it. If the `JSON` file you are using is an *http* or *https* URL, you can leave out the `-v` option.

> **Note:**
> For Linux kernel versions earlier than 4, omit the `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` option.

> **Note:**
> If the Docker container fails to create an SAP HANA instance, you will need to remove the Docker container to try again. Run `docker rm <container_name>` to remove the container. Additionally, you will need to delete the files created in the `/data/directory_name/` directory.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Log into SAP HANA, express edition Container)]

To start your SAP HANA, express edition container, run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it -u <container_name> bash
```

Example:

```
sudo docker exec -it -u express_edition bash
```


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 10: ]((Optional) Test the Container)]

When you are logged into the SAP HANA, express edition container, you can test your installation by entering the following:

```
whoami
```

You should be logged in as `hxeadm`, the default SAP HANA, express edition user.

You can also enter the following:

```
HDB info
```

And you should see the following services running:

* `hdbnameserver`
* `hdbcompileserver`
* `hdbdiserver`
* `hdbwebdispatcher`

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 11: ]((Optional) Log Into System or Tenant Database)]

You can log into the system database with the following command:

```
hdbsql -i 90 -d <system_database> -u SYSTEM -p <password>
```

You can log into your tenant database with the following command:

```
hdbsql -i 90 -d <tenant_database> -u SYSTEM -p <password>
```

__JDBC__

---

To log into your system database via JDBC, use the following command:

```
jdbc:sap://<ip_address>:39017/databaseName=<database_name>
```

To log into your tenant database via JDBC, use the following command:

```
jdbc:sap://<ip_address>:39041/databaseName=<tenant_name>
```

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 12: ]((Optional) Create Additional SAP HANA, express edition Containers)]

You will need to repeat the previous steps of creating a directory and `JSON` password for each additional SAP HANA, express edition container you wish to create.  

```
sudo docker run -p 10013:39013 -p 10017:39017 -p 10041-10045:39041-39045 -p 10028-10029:1128-1129 -p 19013-19014:59013-59014 -v /data/<additional_directory_name>:/hana/mounts \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
--sysctl kernel.shmmax=1073741824 \
--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range='40000 60999' \
--sysctl kernel.shmmni=524288 \
--sysctl kernel.shmall=8388608 \
--name <additional_container_name> \
store/saplabs/hanaexpress:2.00.033.00.20180925.2 \
--passwords-url <file://<path_to_json_file> OR http/https://<url_to_json_file>>
--agree-to-sap-license
```

This process will take several minutes. The prompt will read `Startup finished` once the container has been successfully running. This container starts in detached mode so you will need to open another command prompt to continue.  

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 13: ]((Optional) Update Your Docker Image)]

Update your SAP HANA, express edition Docker image when new versions are released.

Stop your old SAP HANA, express edition Docker image:

```
sudo docker stop <old_container_name>
```

Remove the old Docker image:

```
sudo docker rm <old_container_name>
```

Pull the new Docker image:

```
sudo docker pull store/saplabs/hanaexpress:2.00.033.00.20180925.2
```

Run the new Docker image using the old mounts:

```
sudo docker run -p 39013:39013 -p 39017:39017 -p 39041-39045:39041-39045 -p 1128-1129:1128-1129 -p 59013-59014:59013-59014 -v /data/<old_directory_name>:/hana/mounts \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
--sysctl kernel.shmmax=1073741824 \
--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range='40000 60999' \
--sysctl kernel.shmmni=524288 \
--sysctl kernel.shmall=8388608 \
--name <new_container_name> \
store/saplabs/hanaexpress:2.00.033.00.20180925.2 \
--agree-to-sap-license
```

[ACCORDION-END]
