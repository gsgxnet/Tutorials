## Prerequisites  
- [Prepare your SAP HANA, express edition instance for Machine Learning](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/mlb-hxe-setup-basic.html)

## Details
### You will learn
The pre-built version of R are not compiled with dynamic/shared libraries enable which is required for the SAP HANA integration.

Therefore, you must compile the R package from its source code with the dynamic/shared libraries (`--enable-R-shlib`).

At the end, you will also test the configuration by uploading one of the R built-in dataset (Iris).

Some elements of configuration, such as authentication or SSL, will not be covered in this tutorial.

For further details, you can consult the [SAP HANA R Integration Guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a78d7f701c3341339fafe4031b64f015/2.0.02/en-US/dbad714484d242789688a551fbdf5573.html).

It also includes a section dedicated to debugging and tracing.

To process R code in the context of the SAP HANA database, the R code is embedded in SAP HANA SQL code in the form of a RLANG procedure.

The SAP HANA database uses an external R environment to execute this R code, similarly to native database operations like joins or aggregations.

This allows the application developer to elegantly embed R function definitions and calls within `SQLScript` and submit the entire code as part of a query to the database.

![SAP HANA R integration](00-0.png)

The figure above shows three main components of the integrated solution:

 - the SAP HANA based application
 - the SAP HANA database
 - the R environment.

When the calculation model plan execution reaches an R-operator, the calculation engine's R-client issues a request through the `Rserve` mechanism to create a dedicated R process on the R host.

Then, the R-Client efficiently transfers the R function code and its input tables to this R process, and triggers R execution.

Once the R process completes the function execution, the resulting R data frame is returned to the calculation engine, which converts it.

Since the internal column-oriented data structure used within the SAP HANA database for intermediate results is very similar to the vector-oriented R data frame, this conversion is very efficient.

A key benefit of having the overall control flow situated on the database side is that the database execution plans are inherently parallel and, therefore, multiple R processes can be triggered to run in parallel without having to worry about parallel execution within a single R process.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a Dedicated User)]

As a best practice, it is recommended to create a dedicated user to run your R activities.

This will help avoiding side any effect on the `hxeadm` user that is running the SAP HANA, express edition instances.

For the rest of this tutorial, `radm` will be referred as the R administrator user.

To create `radm` user you can execute the following commands:

```shell
sudo useradd -m -d /home/r -c "R Administrator" radm     
sudo passwd radm
```

Then, you can execute the following command to add the `radm` user to the `sudoer` list which will be required to proceed will the installation:

```shell
sudo bash -c 'echo "radm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >>/etc/sudoers'
sudo bash -c 'echo "umask 022" >>/home/radm/.bashrc'
```

Now, you can switch to the `radm` user if not done yet:

```shell
sudo su -l radm
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Install C Compiler & Required Packages)]

To complete the Jupyter setup, you will need some additional packages

|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|`xorg-x11-devel` 		|`gcc-fortran` 		|`texinfo` 			|
|`readline-devel` 		|`gcc-c++` 			|`cairo-devel` 		|
|`libcurl-devel` 		|`xz-devel` 		|`pcre-devel` 		|

Therefore, you will now add the missing packages.

### **For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (including the SAP HANA, express edition VM):**

First, you will need to check your current status using the following command:

```shell
sudo SUSEConnect --status-text
```

It should return the following information in the console:

```
Installed Products:
------------------------------------------
  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP3
  (SLES_SAP/12.3/x86_64)

  Registered
------------------------------------------
```

If your system is marked as *Not Registered*, then you will need to register  with `SUSEConnect` using your registration code and email:

```shell
sudo SUSEConnect -r <registration code> -e <registration email>
```

Once registered, you will be able to list the available extensions using the following command:

```shell
sudo SUSEConnect --list-extension
```

You can then activate these extensions/repositories using the following commands:

The following extensions/repositories are required to install the Python packages dependencies:

- SUSE Linux Package for SAP Applications 12 SP2

	```shell
	sudo SUSEConnect -p SLES_SAP/12.2/x86_64
	```

- SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 12 SP2

	```shell
	sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.2/x86_64
	```

- `Toolchain` Module

	```shell
	sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-toolchain/12/x86_64
	```

Make sure to adjust the version/extension name based on the result from the ***`--list-extension`*** result.

These commands will be successful only if you have registered your system with `SUSEConnect`:

Then, you can clean and refresh the repository cache:

```shell
sudo zypper refresh
```

Then, you can execute the following command to install the compiler:

```shell
sudo zypper install --type pattern Basis-Devel
```

The following additional dependencies are also required:

```shell
sudo zypper install \
	xorg-x11-devel \
	readline-devel \
	libcurl-devel \
	gcc-fortran \
	gcc-c++ \
	xz-devel \
	pcre-devel \
	texinfo \
	cairo-devel
```

### **For Red Hat Enterprise Linux:**

The following extensions/repositories are required to install the `Development Tools` package group and some additional packages in a later step:

You can add these extensions/repositories using the following commands:

```shell
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms"
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-optional-rpms"
```

Then, you can clean and refresh the repository cache:

```shell
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum repolist
```

Then, you can execute the following command to install the compiler:

```shell
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

The following additional dependencies are also required:

```shell
sudo yum -y install \
    readline-devel \
    libcurl-devel \
    gcc-gfortran \
    gcc-c++ \
    xz-devel \
    pcre-devel \
    texinfo \
    texlive \
    cairo-devel \
    libX* \
    bzip2-devel
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Verify Your Java Installation)]

One the requirement to install and enable the SAP HANA R integration with SAP HANA, express edition is a 64-bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or Higher.

To check if Java is installed, you can run the following command from your terminal console:

```shell
java -version
```

which should return:

```
java version "1.8.0_xx"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_xx-yyy)
```

If you don't have it yet installed, you can check the following link for download link and installation instructions : <https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud>

Using the RPM option is most likely the easiest, as you will have to simply run the following command from your terminal console (where **<version>** needs to be adjusted based on the downloaded version):

```
sudo rpm -ivh <rpm directory>/sapjvm-<version>-linux-x64.rpm
```

Then you will need to update the "alternatives" and enable your flavor of java using the following commands:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/java/sapjvm_8_latest/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/java/sapjvm_8_latest/bin/java
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Install TexInfo)]

[`Texinfo`](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) is the official documentation format of the GNU project and is used by multiple project including R to build the manuals.

However, the `texinfo` package available in most repository does not provide all the tools required to compile R from the ground.

For mode details about `texinfo`, you can visit: [`https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/`](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/).

The `texinfo` required to compile is 5.1, but in this example we will be using a newer version.

In the below script, `curl` is used to download the package, but if your machine is not connected to the Internet, you can download manually the `texinfo` package from [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/) and transfer it.

From your terminal console, execute the following command:

```shell
cd ~
curl http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz -o ~/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz
tar -xf ~/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz

cd ~/texinfo-6.5

./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-static > install.log

make clean >> install-textinfo.log
make >> install-textinfo.log
make info >> install-textinfo.log

sudo make install >> install-textinfo.log
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/texinfo

make clean >> install-textinfo.log
rm ~/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz
```

To verify that your setup is correct you can run the following command:

```shell
texi2any --help
```

No error message should be displayed.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Download, Compile and Install R)]

As explained previously, we need to recompile R with `shlib` enabled in order to use it with SAP HANA, express edition.

In this example we will be using a newer version than the one listed in the PAM.

In the below script, `curl` is used to download the package, but if your machine is not connected to the Internet, you can download manually the `R` package from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and transfer it.

```shell
cd ~
curl https://cloud.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.3.tar.gz -o ~/R-3.4.3.tar.gz
tar -xf ~/R-3.4.3.tar.gz

cd ~/R-3.4.3

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-R-shlib > install-r.log

make clean >> install-r.log
make >> install-r.log
make info >> install-r.log

sudo make install >> install-r.log
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/lib64/R

make clean >> install-r.log
rm ~/R-3.4.3.tar.gz
```

To verify that your setups is correct you can run the following command:

```shell
echo "R.version.string" | R --save -q
```

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Download, Compile and Install Rserve)]

`Rserve` acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets) which allows binary requests to be sent to an R process.

Every connection has a separate workspace and working directory.

Client-side implementations are available for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing any application to use facilities of R without the need of linking to R code.

`Rserve` supports remote connection, user authentication and file transfer.

If your host is connected to the Internet, you can leverage the CRAN mirror to install `Rserve` else you can download it manually and transfer it.

To install the `Rserve` package and make available to every user you should start R as a supper user running the following command:

```shell
sudo R
```
Then you can use the following command if your server is connected to the internet:

```shell
install.packages("Rserve")
```

You will be prompted to select one of the CRAN mirror from which the package will be downloaded.

If your server is not connected to the internet you can use instead:

```shell
cd ~
curl https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/Rserve_1.7-3.tar.gz -o Rserve_1.7-3.tar.gz
install.packages("/<path to Rserve archive>/Rserve_1.7-3.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```
You can find the archive on the cloud mirror: [https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib](https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib)

You can pick version 1.7-3.

Type `q()` to quit your R session as super user.

To verify that the `Rserve` package is properly installed, open a new R session and execute the following command:

```shell
library("Rserve")
```

You should not receive any message after executing the command.

Now, as we installed the `Rserve` as super user, we need to add proper rights to any users executing the following command:

```shell
sudo chmod 755 /usr/lib64/R/bin/Rserve
```
[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Start Rserve)]

You can start `Rserve` using the following command:

```
R CMD Rserve --RS-port <PORT> --no-save --RS-encoding utf8
```

The port for starting `Rserve` has to be chosen wisely as it will be configured in SAP HANA over the next step.

You can use 9999 as this port is not used often:

```shell
R CMD Rserve --RS-port 9999 --no-save --RS-encoding utf8
```

The `--no-save` option makes sure that the invoked R runtime do not store the R environment onto the file system after the R execution has been stopped.

This is important to avoid the file system to be filled over time due to multiple R runs.

There is currently no support for automatically starting the `Rserve` server after rebooting the Linux host.

To accomplish this, you can use `crontab` with a shell script like the following, which starts a new `Rserve` process if none is running:

```
pgrep -u <OS user> -f "Rserve --RS-port <PORT> --no-save --RS-encoding utf8" || R CMD Rserve --RS-port <PORT> --no-save --RS-encoding utf8
```

For example with `hxeadm` on port 9999:

```shell
pgrep -u radm -f "Rserve --RS-port 9999 --no-save --RS-encoding utf8" || R CMD Rserve --RS-port 9999 --no-save --RS-encoding utf8
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Configure SAP HANA)]

To enable the calling of R procedures from SAP HANA, the index server configuration parameters from the `calcEngine` section must be configured.

Connect to the **HXE** tenant using the **SYSTEM** user credentials and execute the following SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ALTER CONFIGURATION ('indexserver.ini', 'SYSTEM') SET ('calcEngine', 'cer_rserve_addresses'  ) = 'localhost:9999' 	WITH RECONFIGURE;
ALTER SYSTEM ALTER CONFIGURATION ('indexserver.ini', 'SYSTEM') SET ('calcEngine', 'cer_timeout'           ) = '300' 			WITH RECONFIGURE;
ALTER SYSTEM ALTER CONFIGURATION ('indexserver.ini', 'SYSTEM') SET ('calcEngine', 'cer_rserve_maxsendsize') = '0' 				WITH RECONFIGURE;
```

You will notice that the port number must correspond to the one used to start `Rserve`.

Now, you need to create the `Rsever` source by executing the following SQL statement:

```sql
CREATE REMOTE SOURCE "Local Rserve"
    ADAPTER "rserve"
    CONFIGURATION 'server=localhost;port=9999';
```

Now, you need to grant the `ML_USER` by executing the following SQL statement:

```sql
GRANT CREATE R SCRIPT TO ML_USER;
```

Then allow the `ML_USER` to access the **`Local Rserve`** source by executing the following SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER USER ML_USER SET PARAMETER RSERVE REMOTE SOURCES = 'Local Rserve';
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Test the configuration)]

In order to test the configuration, you will execute a simple procedure that will read the Iris dataset and store it into a table.

Connect to the **HXE** tenant using the **`ML_USER`** user credentials and execute the following SQL statement:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA R_DATA;

SET SCHEMA R_DATA;
-- Uncomment the drop statement is you want to run it from scratch
-- DROP TABLE 		IRIS;
-- DROP PROCEDURE 	LOAD_IRIS;
-- DROP PROCEDURE 	DISPLAY_IRIS;

CREATE COLUMN TABLE IRIS (
	"Sepal.Length" DOUBLE,
	"Sepal.Width" DOUBLE,
	"Petal.Length" DOUBLE,
	"Petal.Width" DOUBLE,
	"Species" VARCHAR(5000)
);

CREATE PROCEDURE LOAD_IRIS(OUT iris "IRIS")
LANGUAGE RLANG AS
BEGIN
  library(datasets)
  data(iris)
  iris <- cbind(iris)
END;

CREATE PROCEDURE DISPLAY_IRIS()
AS BEGIN
	CALL LOAD_IRIS(iris);
	INSERT INTO IRIS SELECT * FROM  :iris;
END;

CALL DISPLAY_IRIS();
SELECT * FROM IRIS;
```

The Iris dataset will display the measurements in centimeters of the sepal length and width and petal length and width  for about 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. Therefore, the result should display 150 rows.

Execute the following SQL and provide an answer to the question below then click on **Validate**.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM R_DATA.IRIS;
```

[VALIDATE_2]
[ACCORDION-END]
